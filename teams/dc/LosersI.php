			<p>A group of soldiers during the Second World War shared one thing in common, they were losers. Each had experienced severe misfortune 
			in their military careers, which although they survived, cost the lives of their fellow soldiers.</p><br>
			
			<p>Patrol Torpedo Boat commander Captain Storm's ship was sank by a Japanese submarine, which cost his crew their life and him his leg. 
			With a wooden prosthetic, Storm continued his career as a P.T. Boat commander in the Atlantic, only to be sunk once again.</p><br>
			
			<p>Fighter pilot Lieutenant Johnny Cloud suffered discrimination because he was an American Indian. Cloud felt an additional burden borne 
			for every aviator who died under his command. Eventually his guilt led to a crash after his wingman made the ultimate sacrifice.</p><br>
			
			<p>Raised in poverty, Marines; Gunner and Sarge believed they were born losers. After numerous battles in the Pacific, alongside their dog 
			Pooch, the duo were reassigned to Europe to train new recruits. The command was killed on their first combat mission.</p><br>
			
			<p>By coincidence all four men experienced their defeats at about the same time. They were picked up by Lieutenant Jeb Stuart, who commanded 
			a tank he believed to be haunted by the ghost of his ancestor; Confederate General James Ewell Brown (JEB) Stuart. Although born in the northern 
			United States, Stuart's belief compelled him to fly the Confederate flag, which his ancestor commanded under.</p><br>
			
			<p>Stuart had just recently experienced a defeat, and because of their various misfortunes the five men considered they no longer had anything 
			to lose. Persuading the others to join him in a suicidal mission Stuart and the group were uncharacteristically successful.</p><br>
			
			<p>After their success, the military command assigned the group, minus Stuart, to work as a regular detached service task force. Although 
			having a future record of success throughout the European and Pacific theaters of war they never lost their self-image of being
