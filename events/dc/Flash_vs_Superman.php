				<p>Investigating a UFO
				<a href="../../heroes/dc/Superman.php" target="_self">Superman</a> and the

				are captured by two alien races who have been at war for millions of years. The two 
				races, which were once one race, had been at war for so long they had 
				forgotten what started the acrimony. Deciding it was time to end 
				the war one race sent a soldier forward in time making use of time's 
				circular nature - thereby arriving before the beginning of the war. 
				Threatening to destroy the Earth the Flash was forced to travel ahead in 
				time to insure the soldier's mission was successful. The competing 
				alien race sent Superman to foil the Flash because if time were to 
				change then their organic space travel technology would not have seeded
				<a href="../../locations/dc/Krypton.php" target="_self">Krypton</a> 
				with life and thus Superman would not exist. The two heroes race to the end of 
				time dodging obstacles and eventually defeating the aliens.</p><BR>

				<p>Bored,

				<a href="../../heroes/dc/Superman.php" target="_self">Superman</a> and the
				<a href="../../heroes/dc/FlashIII.php" target="_self">Flash</a> 
				would break the tedium. Promising to return to his home dimension for ninety days 
				the Man of Steel was more than willing - although the fifth-dimensional 
				imp had lied as was secretly rooting for the Flash, confident that his 
				foe Superman could beat the Scarlet Speedster. Although the Fasted 
				Man Alive wanted nothing to do with the race Superman used reverse 
				psychology to goad the Flash into agreeing to the race - which was run 
				on a obstacle course racetrack devised by Mxyzptlk. Stretched to 
				the ends of their endurance the two heroes finished the race with the 
				Flash barely winning and Mxyzptlk banished by his own deception.</p><br>
			
				<p><span class="bold">Race #6:</span>
				<a href="../../issues/dc/6thFlashSupermanRace.php" target="_self">DC First: Flash/Superman #1</a> (July, 2002)</p>
				<p>The magician from the future Abra Kadabra escapes from 
				<a href="../../locations/dc/IronHeights.php" target="_self">Iron Heights Prison</a> 
				and plots to return to his own time in the 64th Century. Casting an aging spell upon the citizens of

				and Wally West the newest 
				<a href="../../heroes/dc/FlashIII.php" target="_self">Flash</a>, 
				Abra-Kadabra compels 
				<a href="../../heroes/dc/Superman.php" target="_self">Superman</a> and the original
				<a href="../../heroes/dc/FlashI.php" target="_self">Flash</a>
				- Jay Garrick to race after the young hero in order to stop the spell from killing him, 
				but at the cost of spell being transferred to the swiftest. 
				Borrowing the speed from Superman, Garrick is able to catch his protégé, 
				but Abra-Kadabra uses the resulting energy to escape to the future 
				brining the heroes with him to use as a means to return to their time. 
				At the moment Garrick touches West and the spell is transferred, 
				Superman is able to see the "spell" as nothing more than parasitic 
				nanites. West uses his ability to manipulate molecules to make 
				Garrick intangible while Superman uses his heat vision to destroy the 
				microscopic robots. Meanwhile Abra Kadabra restocks his arsenal of 
				"magic" tricks from the future, but is defeated by the trio of heroes 
				and returned to his prison cell in the 21st Century.</p><br>
