			<p>Delving into the secret of the origin of the universe, the 
			<a href="../../aliens_races/dc/Oan.php" target="_self" >Oan</a>
			scientist <span class="bold">Krona</span> triggered a cataclysm which formed an infinite
			number of dimensions. From the birth of the Multiverse would also be
			born the seeds of a 
			<a href="CrisisOnInfiniteEarths.php" target="_self">Crisis</a>.</p><br>
			
			<p>As punishment for his arrogance and disregard for the safety of the universe, 
			Krona's fellow Oans punished him but did not rob him of his immortality. 
			Reducing him to disembodied energy, Krona was doomed to circle the cosmos harmlessly 
			forever, but was he truly harmless?</p><br>
			
			<p >Breaching the dimensional barriers
			of the Multiverse, Krona continued his quest for the knowledge of the
			Universe's origins, but each dimension was destroyed by his query adding to his power.</p><br>
		  
			<p>Halted by the Elder of the Universe known as the 
			<span class="bold">Grandmaster</span>, Krona was convinced to engage in a
			contest of champions between the heroes of his native universe and the
			universe of the Grandmaster, in exchange for the name of a being who
			existed before the creation of the current reality,
			<a href="../../gods_monsters/marvel/Galactus.php" target="_self">Galactus</a>.</p><br>
      
			<p>With the dimensional barriers weakened, the 
			<a href="../../teams/marvel/Avengers.php" target="_self" >Avengers</a>
			and <a href="../../teams/dc/JLA.php" target="_self" >Justice League</a>
			were plagued by menaces from their counterpart's respective
			universes. Deceived into collecting 12 powerful items from both universes
			both teams were destined for conflict.</p><br>
		  
			<p>Traveling to the other dimension
			the Avengers were mystified by a planet were the heroes were unquestioningly
			revered to the point of god worship, while the Justice League was disturbed
			by a planet which appeared dystopian and seemed ill served by its
			superhumans.</p><br>
		  
			<p>Draw together, the two superhero teams first meeting was violent and only brought 
			to a halt by the 
			<a href="../../heroes/marvel/ScarletWitch.php" target="_self">Scarlet Witch</a>, 
			whose powers were boosted by the Chaos energy of the Justice League's universe.</p><br>
		  
			<p>Eventually working together the heroes of both universes bring together the 12 
			items of power, which the Grandmaster uses to attempt a merging of the two universes 
			with the intent of trapping Krona at their nexus. Undaunted, Krona attempts to fully
			merge the universes in an attempt of creating a new Big Bang which will
			unlock his desire, the secret of the Universe's origin.</p><br>
