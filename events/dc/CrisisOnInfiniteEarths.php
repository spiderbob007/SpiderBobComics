			<p>At the dawn of time and space a cataclysmic explosion created a cosmic current sparking
			the transformation of the one universe into a 
			<a target="_self" href="../../locations/dc/Multiverse.php" target="_self">Multiverse</a>, 
			an infinite number of parallel universes existing in the same place in time, but separated by barriers 
			of vibrations at different harmonic frequencies. Originating from the planet 
			<a href="../../locations/dc/Oa.php" target="_self">Oa</a> the cataclysm created the Qward universe, 
			a dark dimension of anti-matter where evil always prevails.</p><br>
			
			<p>Both positive-matter and anti-matter realms had their champions, near-omnipotent
			beings respectively known as the <span class="bold">Monitor</span> and the 
			<a href="../../gods_monsters/dc/Anti-Monitor.php" target="_self">Anti-Monitor</a>.<p><br> 
			
			<p>Dormant for nine billion years, the Anti-Monitor was awoken, when the scientist who 
			would become known as <span class="bold">Pariah</span>, unleashed Qward's anti-matter 
			energy into his positive-matter universe. The breach destroyed Pariah's universe and 
			began the systematic destruction of the Multiverse. Pariah's breach into the
			anti-matter universe also awoke the Monitor, who gathered a battalion of
			select heroes and villains from multiple dimensions in a hopes of stemming the 
			Anti-Monitor's assault and save the the positive-matter universes.</p><br>
		
			<p>Aided by the Monitor's assistant, <span class="bold">Harbinger</span>,
			those selected from the five Earths battle to save the universe from the Anti-Monitor's
			chaotic energies. The Monitor in turn allows his life to be
			sacrificed to create a neatherverse to protect the five planets: 
			<span class="bold">Earth-1</span>, <span class="bold">Earth-2</span>, 
			<span class="bold">Earth-4</span>, <span class="bold">Earth-S</span> and 
			<span class="bold">Earth-X</span> 
			from the Anti-Monitors schemes, but it results in the planets being partially
			merged. As the war rages heroes live and die, with 
			<a href="../../heroes/dc/SupergirlII.php" target="_self">Supergirl II</a> and 
			<a href="../../heroes/dc/FlashII.php" target="_self">Flash II</a> of Earth-1, 
			surrendering their lives to prevent the Anti-Monitor's schemes from succeeding. 
			Weakened by Supergirl and the Flash's separate attacks the Anti-Monitor reasons 
			that the key to ultimate victory is at the moment of creation. Creating a
			temporal vortex the Anti-Monitor travels back through the centuries
			waiting to ambush his foes. Meanwhile the most powerful
			legion of super-villains ever assembled attempt to take control of the
			partially merged planets. The battle between the heroes and villains
			is halted by the 
			<a href="../../heroes/dc/SpectreI.php" target="_self">Spectre</a>
			who has the heroes of the Multiverse challenge the Anti-Monitor at the beginning 
			of space and time, while the villains travel into the past in an attempt to stop Krona's
			experiment on the planet Oa.</p><br>
			
			<p>At the dawn of creation, the heroes of the Multiverse
			witness the horror of a clash between the Anti-Monitor and near omnipotent Spectre.
			As the universe is ripped asunder during this titanic clash, the fabric of
			time is rewoven and reality appears to return to normal, until it is
			realized that where once existed an infinite number of parallel
			universes, now there is only one, combined from elements and histories of
			each of the remaining merged universes. Created from this merging is
			<span class="bold">Earth-Sigma</span>,
			where the remaining heroes make their final triumphant stand against the
			Anti-Monitor, forever ending his treat to the remaining universe.
			Although victorious, the effects of the Anti-Monitor's plot cannot be
			undone. Mercifully a ripple in the timestream erased from memory any
			awareness there had ever been any universe other than one, except for a
			now maddened

			<p>The Crisis on Infinite Earths was both an economic and artistic decision designed to
			breath new life into the characters of the DC universe as well as relieve
			the creative and editorial staff of a burdensome and conflicting
			continuity accumulated over 45 years.</p><br>

			<p>The title <em>Crisis On Infinite Earths</em> came from a story arc by writer/editor Garner Fox in 
			<a href="../../issues/dc/CrisisonEarth1.php" target="_self">Justice League of America Vol. 1 #21</a> (Aug. 1962) 
			and 
			<a href="../../issues/dc/CrisisonEarth2.php" target="_self">Justice League of America Vol. 1 #22</a> (Sept. 1962), 
			titled <em>Crisis on Earth-One!</em> and <em>Crisis on Earth-Two!</em>, in which the 
			<a href="../../teams/dc/JLA.php" target="_self">Justice League of America</a> 
			on Earth-1 teamed with the 
			<a href="../../teams/dc/JSA.php" target="_self">Justice Society of America</a> 
			on Earth-2 to stop a group of villains from both
			Earths which had plans to conquer the planets. This story began the concept of a multiverse.</p><br>
			
			<p>To understand the DC Universe, readers must think of	history in aspects of Pre-Crisis and 
			Post-Crisis.</p><br>
			
			<span class="left">
			<p>Examples of alterations in continuity created by the Crisis on Infinite Earths are:</p><br>
			<p><span class="bold">1.</span> Pre-Crisis Princess Diana, the 
			<a href="../../heroes/dc/WonderWomanI.php" target="_self">Wonder Woman</a> 
			from World War II and a member of the Justice Society of America, became 
			<a href="../../heroes/dc/WonderWomanIII.php" target="_self">Hippolyta</a> 
			the mother of the current Wonder Woman, in effect making Princess Diana Wonder
			Woman II, as opposed to Wonder Woman I.</p><br>
			
			<p><span class="bold">2.</span>In the Post-Crisis world there never existed either a 
			Superbaby or Superboy. Kent's powers as 
			<a href="../../heroes/dc/Superman.php" target="_self">Superman</a>
			did not develop until puberty.</p><br>
			
			<p><span class="bold">3.</span>In the Post-Crisis world Selina Kyle 
			(<a href="../../villains/dc/CatwomanI.php" target="_self">Catwoman</a>)
			never married Bruce Wayne (<a href="../../heroes/dc/BatmanI.php" target="_self">Batman</a>)
			having a daughter who would become Huntress II, nor did Dick Grayson continue his career as 
			<a href="../../heroes/dc/RobinI.php" target="_self">Robin</a> into adulthood.</p><br>
			</span>
			
			<p>The apparent benefits of the Crisis is for the creative
			staff of DC Comics and die-hard fans only, because due to the nature of
			characters in periodic publications, only the story arcs being published
			by the current creators of the past few years generally have relevance to
			most readers. A good analogy of this phenomenon would be the <em>James Bond 007</em>
			films. All the characters change, except for Bond, who is obviously
			played by different actors, yet everyone accepts him as the same guy.</p><br>
