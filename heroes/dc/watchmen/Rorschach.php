			<p>Born into poverty and depravity, the only child of a street prostitute, Walter Kovacs was seen by his abusive mother as a burden. 
			Smaller than other children, Korvac was often the target of neighborhood bullies.</p><br>
			
			<p>At age ten years old Korvac violently resolved an altercation with a pair of bullies, one of which he partially blinded with the 
			bully's own cigarette. The incident caused authorities to investigate Korvac's home environment and he was admitted to the Lillian 
			Charlton Home for Problem Children.</p><br>
			
			<p>Although withdrawn and haunted by sexually themed nightmares, Korvac seemed to adjust well to his life at Charlton. When he was 
			age sixteen Korvac was notified of his mother's death by being forced to ingest Drano cleaning fluid at the hands of her pimp - his 
			only response was 'Good.' Shortly after his mother's death Korvac left the childrens home to take employment as a menial garment worker.</p><br>
	
			<p>While working in the garment industry, Korvac became interested in a new material made possible by technologies developed by Dr. 
			Manhattan. The fabric, which contained black and white viscous fluids which never mixed into grays between two layers of latex, had been 
			ordered by a woman to make a dress, but she declined the order because she thought it looked ugly. Korvac brought the dress home and 
			experimented with fashioning it into a mask.</p><br>
	
			<p>After Kitty Genovese was raped, tortured and killed outside her own apartment building while almost forty neighbors, some of which 
			watched from their windows did nothing, Korvac convinced himself that it was the same woman who had originally ordered the dress. Donning 
			his mask, a hat and trench coat, Korvac embarked on a career as the vigilante <span class="bold">Rorschach</span>.</p><br>
