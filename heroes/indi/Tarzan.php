			<p>During the late 19th Century a young English nobleman John Clayton, Lord Greystoke was assigned to a diplomatic duty in 
			West Africa. Not desiring the duty due to his newlywed wife Lady Alice being pregnant, she encouraged her husband to serve 
			in the duty of the royal crown.</p><br>
			
			<p>After reaching the African coast, Lord and Lady Greystoke acquired transport aboard a small ship lead by a cruel captain. 
			During the course of their journey tempers became strained between the ship's officers and crew when the captain assaulted 
			and elderly sailor. The old sailor was defended by a few crewmates known as Black Michael. When the captain sought to shoot 
			Black Michael down Lord Greystoke intervened and what would have been a fatal shot became a wound.</p><br>
			
			<p>Within days the crew mutinied under the leadership of Black Michael. Owing Lord Greystoke his life, Black Michael set Lord 
			and Lady Greystoke upon an unknown shore with their possessions and provisions, partly to protect him and partly to protect 
			them from the ship's crew.</p><br>
			
			<p>Overcoming despair Lord and Lady Greystoke made shelter until such time that the British Navy would discover and rescue 
			them that time never came. Within a month Lady Greystoke gave birth to a son after an assault by a bull ape. Within the next 
			year the couple survived additional assaults, but eventually they both perished, Alice from grief and John from an ape attack 
			shortly after her death, leaving their toddler son alone in the jungle.</p><br>
			
			<p>Amongst the throng of apes that investigated the crude cabin built by Lord Greystoke was a female who had recently lost 
			her child. When she discovered the human offspring she adopted him as her own.</p><br>
			
			<p>Protected and nursed by his adopted mother, he developed physically slower than the ape children, but the boy was more 
			intelligent than his fellow tribe members. Using his intelligence to survive in time his physical strength would begin to 
			match that of the other beasts of the jungle and he would become known as <span class="bold">Tarzan, Lord of the Apes</span>.</p><br>
