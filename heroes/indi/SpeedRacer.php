			<p>After quiting his job for a major car manufacturer Pops started his own company and racing team, with his older son

			compete professionally, and the eldest son's hubris cost him a major race when he wrecked the car in the final lap. Pop's

			world's greatest race car driver. Fukumen would return years later as the guardian angel of his younger brother in the guise 
			of the mysterious masked racer known as Racer X.</p><br>
			
			<p>When G&#333; turned 18 years old, he became his father's newest star racer. Fearing that his temper would cost him 
			yet another son, Pops vowed to support his son's ambitions by creating the ultimate racecar; the <i>Mach 5</i>. Armed with 
			a unique array of offensive and defensive features, G&#333; Mifune races the Mach 5 around the world in the most exotic
