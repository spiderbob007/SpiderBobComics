			<p>Born over five hundred years ago in a small village called Kamar-Taj hidden within the Himalayas of Tibet, the 
			young man who would become known as the Ancient One was a peaceful farmer. When his longtime friend Kaluu gained 
			mystical knowledge he shared it with the youth. Exploring magic together the duo learned to harness great mystical 
			energies, but their motives began to diverge. Kaluu's aspirations leaned toward tyranny and he desired to create a 
			vast empire. Together the mystics eliminated disease, poverty, suffering and even death from Kamar-Taj, but Kaluu 
			was secretly manipulating the citizen's minds influencing them to crown him king. Kaluu's manipulations compelled 
			the otherwise peaceful citizens to muster an army to conquer and enslave their neighbors.</p><br>
			
			<p>Paralyzing the youth after he attempted to foil Kaluu's plans, the future Ancient One was powerless and had to 
			watch as the village fell into decadence. Although immobile the youth was able to cast a spell that inadvertently 
			caused a pestilence which wiped out the village and caused Kaluu to take refuge within another dimension. His 
			adversary gone the spell of paralysis was broken.</p><br>
			
			<p>Although no longer immortal, the youth would now age at a very slow rate, so that he would not reach the end 
			of his life span for five centuries. Leaving the village of his birth the youth devoted his life to combating 
			other evil sorcerers. Seeking out mystics whose elder members were known as Ancient Ones, he dedicated his long 
			life to serving the forces of order in the Universe eventually himself becoming an
