			<p>The first bearer of the Quantum Bands was Robert Grayson, whose father astrophysicist Dr. Horace 
			Grayson, in the years before World War II, made contact with a colony of 
			<a href="../../aliens_races/marvel/Eternals.php" target="_self">Eternals</a> on the planet Uranus. The 
			Eternals sent Dr. Grayson the information to build an interstellar spacecraft and he and his son traveled 
			to the eighth planet in Earth's solar system.</p><br>
			
			<p>Unknown to the Graysons, the Uranian Eternals were exiled to the eighth planet for crimes in Earth's 
			distant past. The criminal exiles discovered that the planet was inhabited by a native subterranean collective 
			- who they made a pact with, but at the expense of ever being able to leave the planet. When Grayson contacted 
			the Eternals on Uranus they saw an opportunity to return to Earth. Desiring an ambassador to pave the way 
			for their return, the Eternals trained the younger Grayson's mind and body and granted him a set of powerful 
			Quantum Bands, sending him to Earth to be the hero known as 
			<a href="MarvelBoyII.php" target="_self">Marvel Boy</a>.</p><br>
			
			<p>Unknown to Marvel Boy the Eternals of Uranus were constructing his duplicate to eventually replace him. 
			Using Grayson's Quantum Headband as a transmitter, the duplicate learned of Earth and Marvel Boy's exploits. 
			When the native Uranians learned of the Eternals' intent to abandon their figurative collective they destroyed 
			them for this cultural betrayal. Before they were completely destroyed the Eternals recalled Marvel Boy claiming 
			that the colony was being irradiated from the planet's core. By the time Marvel Boy returned, the last city was 
			destroyed and his technology began to fail leaving him vulnerable to the hostile environment of the planet. 
			Taking pity upon the human, the native Uranians invited Grayson into their collective where he was physically 
			altered becoming more like them. Given limited autonomy to explore the planet surface, Grayson discovered his 
			dormant duplicate, which was rushed to completion before his cognition was resolved. Unable to make sense of his 
			reality with an incongruous assortment of memories the unstable duplicate rushed to Earth going on a rampage as the 
			<span class="bold">Crusader</span>. Challenging the 
			<a href="../../teams/marvel/FantasticFour.php" target="_self">Fantastic Four</a>, the Crusader accidentally 
			disintegrated himself by improperly channeling solar energy through his Quantum Bands.</p><br>
			
			<p><a href="MrFantastic.php" target="_self">Dr. Reed Richards</a> turned custody of the Quantum Bands over to 
			<a href="../../teams/marvel/SHIELD.php" target="_self">S.H.I.E.L.D.</a> to be studied by Dr. Gilbert Vaughn, 
			who hypothesized that the bands were power-transformers able to utilize cosmic energy sources. Dr. Vaughn got 
			permission to use his son, S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Wendell Vaughn as a test subject. When the younger Vaughn placed 
			the Quantum Bands on his wrist he discovered that they affixed themselves to him permanently. Undergoing special 
			training in S.H.I.E.L.D.'s super-agent program he learned to harness the Quantum Band's energies as 
			<span class="bold">Marvel Man</span>.</p><br>
			
			<p>After S.H.I.E.L.D. retired the super-agent program, Vaughn continued to use his cosmic powers as 
			<span class="bold">Quasar</span>.</p><br>
