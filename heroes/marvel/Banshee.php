			<p>Heir to the castle and estate of Cassidy Keep, Ireland, Sean Cassidy was born wealth, but desired to go into 
			law enforcement, joining Interpol after graduation college. Although Cassidy knew about his mutant powers he did 
			not divulge them to anyone including his wife, Maeve Rourke.</p><br>
			
			<p>While at Interpol, Cassidy was assigned a top secret mission, which required him to go under deep cover. While 
			under cover, his wife discovered she was pregnant and gave birth in his absence to their daughter Theresa 
			(<a href="Siryn.php" target="_self">Siryn</a>). While visiting relatives in Northern Ireland, Maeve was killed by 
			a terrorist bombing. No trace of Theresa was found and she was assumed dead. It was revealed years later that 
			Cassidy's cousin Tom (<a href="../../villains/marvel/BlackTom.php" target="_self">Black Tom</a>), knowing of Sean's 
			powers, abducted the infant in hopes that she would have similar abilities.</p><br>
			
			<p>Returning from his mission, Cassidy focused his grief of his wife's death into his career. He was never informed 
			he had a daughter to spare him additional misery. The melancholy Cassidy left Interpol to work as a mercenary. 
			Although never arrested, his activities did not go unnoticed.</p><br>
			
			<p>Cassidy was approached by a representative of a mutant terrorist group known as Factor Three, called the 
			Changeling. Cassidy refused, but was forced to join by the use of an explosive headband, which would be remotely 
			detonated if he refused or attempted to remove it. He was code named <span class="bold">Banshee</span> by the groups 
			leader, Mutant Master, and assigned to a human operative known as Ogre.</p><br>
			
			<p>A mission for Factor Three in New York would bring Banshee into conflict with the X-Men. He and Ogre were captured. 
			<a href="ProfessorX.php" target="_self">Professor Xavier</a> freed Banshee from his explosive headband and he joined 
			the X-Men against Factor Three, revealing their leader the Mutant Master as a member of the extraterrestrial Nox.</p><br>
			
			<p>Cassidy would return to his Irish homeland, but later join Professor Xavier in a rescue mission of his original 
			students, as a member of the all new all different X-Men.</p><br>
