			<p>A cabal by several Hell-Lords conspired to create a child via a human woman which would serve as a living battery 
			drawing in the black energies created by the sins of mankind to give them the power to break through the walls of reality.</p><br>
			
			<p>The demons created a being from their own aspects, the demon Marduk Kurios, who assumed the name Satan and came to 
			Earth in human form. Drawn to a the human woman Victoria Wingate, who had been secretly conditioned by a satanic cult 
			known as the Chapel of Dresden, the two married and produced both a son, Daimon, and a daughter 
			<a href="Satana.php" target="_self">Satana</a>.</p><br>
			
			<p>Despite satanic rituals being practiced in her home, Wingate and her son Daimon were unaware of Satan's true nature 
			- although his daughter Satana often participated in her father's abominable rituals. It was when such a ritual was 
			discovered by Wingate that she say her husband's true face and was driven insane and eventually institutionalized.</p><br>
			
			<p>Satana was taken to Hell and raised by Satan while Daimon spent his childhood in an orphanage. While in a sanitarium 
			Wingate wrote a diary recounting her life with Satan. She also acquired a mystical amulet which upon her deathbed she 
			would bequeath to her son to protect him from his father's notice.</p><br>
			
			<p>Spending the rest of his childhood in the orphanage, Daimon would eventually enter the priesthood. Before he was ordained 
			Daimon would receive notification of his inheritance. Acquiring his mother's diary he learned the disturbing truth.</p><br>
			
			<p>Telepathically contacted by Satan, Daimon was invited to join him in his demonic realm. Traveling through a secret 
			interdimensional passage in his family home's basement, Daimon was beseeched by his father to ignore his mother's warnings 
			and join him to serve in Hell. Given time to consider his options, Daimon decided to use his powers to challenge his 
			father's evil. Invading Satan's realm he stole a mystic trident and chariot which he would use to battle evil as the
