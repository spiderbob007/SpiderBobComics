				<p><span class="title">History of Comics</span></p>
					<p>Arguably, claims can be made that comics have been around since the days when Cro-Magnon man painted cave 
					walls with pictographs representing the hunt, harvest or equally life essential events. As time went on, humans' 
					early depictions would find expression in great monuments to themselves and their gods. Leap forward thousands 
					of years from the days of Egyptian hieroglyphics depicting god-like beings performing great and mystical wonders 			
					to the 20<sup>th</sup> Century when god-like beings performing great scientific and magical wonders would find a 
					home in the modern myths known as comic books.</p>
		
			<span id="a2"></span>
				<p><span class="heading">Golden-Age:</span>
					Although comics had existed since the late 19<sup>th</sup> Century, an era referred to by some as the Platinum-Age, 
					it was not until the introduction by National Periodicals (DC Comics) of Superman in 
					<a href="../issues/dc/1stSuperman.php" target="_self"><em>Action Comics #1</em></a> in June of 1938, and the 
					addition of other heroes in the days during the Second World War, that comics would become a cultural phenomena 
					read by people of all ages.</p>

					<p>It was during the war years, known as the golden-age of comics, that many of the characters we know today, or 
					the predecessors to their more well-known modern equivalents, were created. A small sample of characters that have 
					prevailed since the golden-age are: Aquaman, Batman, Captain America, Captain Marvel (SHAZAM), Flash, Green Lantern, 
					Hawkman, Human Torch, Plastic Man, Superman and Wonder Woman.</p>

					<p>Golden-age comics are the rarest and most desired by the majority of collectors and therefore are typically the 
					most expensive comics to collect. The reasons that these comics are rare (beyond the ravages of age upon pulp paper) 			
					is because many were recycled for the war effort during the 1940's and that many children and their parents saw no 			
					future value in keeping them. Often junior's musty old box of comics was left at the curbside for the garbage man 			
					to collect. Needless to say, if you have a golden-age comic, much less one in pristine condition, you have a rare 
					prize.</p>
			
			<span id="a3"></span>
				<p><span class="heading">Silver-Age:</span>
					In the decade of the 1950's, super-hero comics saw a marketable downtrend. The few to survive the publishing 
					chopping-block included Batman and Superman, whose stories took on more of an air of science-fiction and fantasy. 
					The majority of comics during this decade, referred to by some as the Atomic-Age, aped what was popular in 
					television and movies; cowboys, gangsters, monsters and atomic destruction. It was not until the Autumn of 1956 
					that superheroes began to make a comeback with the re-introduction of the Flash by National Periodicals (DC Comics) 
					in the pages of <a href="../issues/dc/1stFlashII.php" target="_self"><em>Showcase #4</em></a>.</p>
					
					<p>The character's powers were essentially the same as his golden-age predecessor, but the stories had more of a 
					science-fiction sensibility. After the success of the Flash, an heir to the mantle of the Green Lantern was 
					introduced in the Autumn of 1959, and in the Spring of 1960 the concept of the super-hero team was resurrected 
					with the Justice League of America in the pages of <em>The Brave and The Bold</em>.</p>
					
					<p>Silver-age comics are less rare than golden-age comics and therefore typically less valuable, but valuable none 
					the less. The Silver-Age, in addition to reintroducing characters that were popular during the prior decade, also saw 					
					the introduction of popular characters by then Atlas Comics, now known as Marvel. A small sample of these characters are: 			
					Daredevil, Fantastic Four, Incredible Hulk, Iron Man, Spider-Man, Thor, the X-Men and the reintroduction of the original 
					Captain America in the pages of the superhero team book titled the <em>Avengers</em>.</p>

			<span id="a4"></span>		
				<p><span class="heading">Modern-Age:</span>
					The most controversial of ages, not only for when it began but also because many comics collectors debate the very 
					name of its description. For my money, the Modern-Age, or as some call it the Bronze-Age, began in October of 1970 
					with the introduction of Conan the Barbarian to comics. Although Conan as a character had been published since late 
					1932 in the pages of pulp magazines and later in hardback collections, this was the first introduction of the 
					sword-and-sorcery character to the comics medium. For all intents and purposes another comic could serve as a 
					benchmark, but Conan was unique among comics of that time and set forth a trend that would lure back many mature 
					readers which had been lost to the industry after the Second World War. This trend would also see increased 
					popularity in mature themed magazine sized comics such as <em>Creepy</em>, <em>Heavy Metal</em> and 
					<em>Weird Tales</em>.</p>
					
					<p>The Modern-Age by definition has not seen a strictly demarcated cutoff period. Although comics did see a downturn in 
					the mid-1990's, due to over production and speculation by collectors, the subsequent resuscitation of the industry 
					has been so recent that it has not garnered an overarching label. Perhaps the introduction of digital comics early 
					in the 21<sup>st</sup> Century demarcates a new era in comics, where print comics begin a decline in favor of comics 
					delivered via the Internet? Although more convenient that paper, I can not see digital comics becoming a collectible item, 
					and I hope that there will always be a market for "old-fashioned" funny books.</p>
					
					<p>Comics publishing as a rule has been a diverse industry since the 1970's, with an explosion of independent publishers 
					during the 1980's. Most titles by major publishers have enjoyed extended publishing runs in large quantities insuring that 
					these comics are, and may be for a long time into the future, relatively affordable. Nothing occurred in the last three decades 
					of the 20<sup>th</sup> Century to threaten the industry beyond its own shortsightedness and greed, but that can be said for 
					quite a few industries of the later 20<sup>th</sup> Century.</p>

					<p>Modern-age comics are the least rare, due to the sheer number and quantity of titles published, and therefore 
					are the least valuable in the aggregate. Many of the books from this time period that increased in value and 
					maintained their collectability did so because of the introduction of popular characters within the comic's 
					publication run. A small sample of characters that lead to the rise in value of the comic in which they first 
					appeared are: Bullseye, Elektra, Punisher, Sabretooth, Venom and Wolverine. Although many of these supporting 			
					characters have been popular within the pages of established titles very few characters introduced in the past 
					30 years have been able to consistently sustain their own ongoing title.</p>

				<p><span class="title">Storage</span></p>
					<p>Remember that one of the joys of collecting is looking back on the comics that you have amassed and having 
					pride in their condition. If you choose to part with your acquisitions you also want to get the most from your 			
					investment. That being said, I can never emphasize enough the necessity of bagging, boarding and storing your 
					comics upright in some sort of covered box away from light and moisture.</p>				
			
			<span id="b2"></span>
				<p><span class="heading">Bags:</span> 
					Comics bags are designed to protect your investment from moisture, pollutants, oils, and acids. They come in 
					several varieties of quality and expense from high-end Mylar, medium-quality polypropylene and low-end 
					polyethylene. Unless you have a massive golden-age collection to protect, standard clear polypropylene 
					comics bags are perfectly fine and, in the short term, a more affordable option than Mylar.</p>
					
					<p>Mylar is the recommended archival medium of the 
					<a target="_blank" href="http://loc.gov/">U.S. Library of Congress</a> because it does not have any volatile 
					chemicals which will migrate to the surface of the paper causing damage, but Mylar averages about 25 cents a 
					bag versus less than 10 cents a bag for polypropylene. Because of its stable nature Mylar, under optimal 
					conditions, will last over a century, as opposed to polypropylene, which is recommended to be replaced every
					decade. Therefore, because poly would cost you 30 cents in thirty years, Mylar would be a less expensive 
					option if you intend on owning your comics for more than three decades.</p>

					<p>Comics bags come in a variety of sizes: golden-age (7-5/8 x 10-1/4 w/flap), silver-age (7-3/8 x 10-1/4 w/flap), 
					regular (7-1/8 x 10-1/4 w/flap) and treasury (10-1/2 x 13-1/2 w/flap). My recommendation is to use standard size 
					<a target="_blank" href="http://www.egerber.com">Mylites2</a> bags, which will fit not only your silver-age comics, 
					but your current comics as well. These bags work very well with silver-age backing boards. You may choose to purchase 					
					your bags as you need them from your retailer of choice, but bulk options are available online by searching for 
					"comics bags." You can usually request a sample pack from the supplier to determine what is best for your collection.</p>			
			
			<span id="b3"></span>
				<p><span class="heading">Boards:</span> 
					Comics backing boards are designed to keep your comics spine, cover and internal pages from becoming creased and 
					bent. Acid-free backing boards are recommended to ensure the long-term quality of your comics. You should only 
					need backing boards if you use polypropylene or thin Mylar bags, 4 mil Mylar is typically rigid enough that it 
					will protect your comic from bending.</p>
					
					<p>Most comics boards generally have two different surface textures; flat and glossy. I have rarely seen backing 
					boards with a flat texture on both sides. There appears to be an unresolved debate about which side you should 
					store your comics against, which has led me to believe that either side is fine. The manufacturer does not include 
					instructions for use and advertises the product as "acid free," which would lead me to the conclusion that the 
					entire board is acid free. If there is a side to the board that could damage your comics, then I could foresee a
					lawsuit in the future for the manufacturer of comics boards.</p>
					
					<p>There is also the option of buffered backing boards, which are impregnated with calcium carbonate to mop-up 
					the acids emitted by the newsprint in older comics. Although this sounds intriguing I have never used these types 
					of boards and cannot recommend them either way.</p>

					<p>Comics backing boards correspond in size to comics bags. Like bags I recommend using silver-age boards - although it 
					may depend upon the true size of your bags and how snug the board fits. You may also choose to purchase your boards as you 
					need them from your retailer of choice, but bulk options are available online by searching for "comics backing boards."</p>			
			
			<span id="b4"></span>
				<p><span class="heading">Boxes:</span> 
					Comics storage boxes are designed to not only protect your comics from the fading effects of light exposure, but also 
					allow you to organize your collection. Boxes come in a variety of materials ranging from cardboard, acid-free cardboard 
					and plastic. They range in sizes from short (150 comics) to long (250 comics) and magazine sizes.</p>
					
					<p>Comics must be stored in an upright position to avoid spine rolling.</p>

					<p>Instead of boxes I use <a target="_blank" href="http://www.hon.com/">HON</a>  brand legal-size vertical filing cabinets. 
					Each cabinet drawer can store 500 golden-age size comics. The comics can be stored  side-by-side and the length of the 
					drawer can be adjusted to ensure the books  stand upright. I purchased my cabinets about ten years ago at
					<a target="_blank" href="http://www.officedepot.com">Office Depot</a> for about $150 each, but you can purchase them at 
					any office supply store or possibly second hand at a military or government surplus dealer.</p>
					
					<p>I have received a lot of e-mails concerning the model number of filing cabinets that I use and what I recommend. 
					I have determined that the model number is irrelevant as to the interior width and height of the cabinet, although there 
					are apparently differences in interior depth. As to the overall exterior size of the cabinet, I recommend using whatever 
					best fits your storage needs and available home space. There appears to be only two configurations for drawers; two 
					and four. The later being about 5 feet tall.</p>
					
					<p>When determining a cabinet that will work for your needs the best suggestion I can make is to go to your local 
					office supply retailer and using two golden-age-sized backboards, hold them side by side in the drawer and if there 
					is a reasonable amount of space between them then the cabinet should accommodate any standard comic book published 
					since 1938. The other suggestion I would make is that the adjustable slide at the back of the cabinet have a reasonable 
					amount of surface space as to not cause creasing or bending of your comics at the back of the drawer. I hope this covers 
					most of the bases, but if it doesn't then don't hesitate to pepper me with further questions in the 
					<a href="https://www.facebook.com/spiderbobforum" target="_blank">forum</a>.</p>
					
					<p>For your more expensive comics I recommend either a fire-proof filing cabinet for large collections, or a small fire 
					safe for just a few of your more prized comics. It's a little more expensive, but worth it.</p>

				<p><span class="heading">Cataloging:</span> 
					Although collecting comics is fun - keeping track of which ones you own and which ones you would like to own can be a pain in 
					the rear. There are several programs available which can help you keep track of your collection, but in my humble opinion none 
					of them are worth the price. Although I now keep track of my comics using an on-line SQL database, I have found that Microsoft Access is 
					an adequate program for tracking my collection and also teaches basic database management skills - something which is actually 
					useful and may be able to make you some money in your career. Keeping all this in mind I have generously provided a 
					<a href="../comicsdb/ComicsInventoryBase.zip" target="_blank">LINK</a> to the basic code of the database. Feel free to download, 
					modify and expand to meet your particular needs.</p>

				<p><span class="title">Grading & Condition</span></p>
					<p>As location, location, location is to real estate, condition, condition, condition is to collectibles. A prime example of how 
					the condition of a comic affects its value would be <a href="../issues/marvel/1stSpider-ManI.php" target="_self"><em>Amazing Fantasy #15</em></a>, 
					the first appearance of Spider-Man, which sells for around $1.1 million in near-mint condition, but would sell for around $1,400 in poor condition. 
					Granted that is a pretty penny either way, but if I were to sell a near-mint copy I could afford a yacht, where as a poor comic would buy a 
					small motor boat - maybe.</p>
			
			<span id="c2"></span>
				<p><span class="heading">Grading Scales:</span> 
					Comics grading scales from worst to best rating are; poor, fair, good, very-good, fine, very-fine, near-mint and mint. Most new
					comics fall into the near-mint category and therefore it is the bench mark by which all other comics are graded. Mint comics are 
					rare, even for new comics, because of normal handling by printers, distributors, retailers and buyers.</p>

					<p>Values are determined by the "market" and prices can be found in a number of sources. Some of these sources include free online 
					services such as <span class="bold"><a href="http://www.comicspriceguide.com" target="_blank">ComicsPriceGuide.com</a></span>,
					books like the <em>Overstreet Price Guide</em> which contain almost every comic published. <em>Overstreet Price Guide</em> can 
					be found at most retail book stores or comics retailers. Remember that each guide is based upon "market" value and may have different 
					prices for the same comic. That being said, the ultimate arbitrator of what a comic is worth is how much you are willing to pay, and the 
					monetary or trade value the owner is willing to accept.</p>

					<p><span class="heading">Poor:</span> 
					The crap of the crop. Generally unsuitable for collecting or reading because of the extent of damage. Damages range from water 
					soaked or mud encrusted, to ripped-to-shreds by an animal or mutant vegetable. Cover or pages may be missing, torn or cut. Poor 
					comics sell for about 5-15% of near-mint value.</p>

					<p><span class="heading">Fair:</span> 
					This comic has definitely seen better days and has limited market value. Damages may include soiling and damage to the cover and 
					interior pages due to age or abuse. A common "fair" comic is an otherwise flawless comic that has a coupon or ad removed from the 
					interior pages. Fair comics are intact and fine for reading or lending to friends and family. Fair comics sell for about 10-20% 
					of near-mint value.</p>
					
					<p><span class="heading">Good:</span> 
					A comic with a few miles on it and starting to show its age. Cover and pages may have a number of major wrinkles, flakes or chips, 
					but should not have any major tears. Cover may be dull and pages may be yellowed and brittle. Good comics sell for about 20-30% of 
					near mint-value.</p>
					
					<p><span class="heading">Very-Good:</span> 
					A comic with a little read-wear, but still holds onto its looks. Common condition of older books. Cover may have lost its glossy 
					luster and have minor wrinkles, flakes or chips, but has no sign of abuse or defacement. Very-good comics sell for about 30-40% 
					of near-mint value.</p>

					<p><span class="heading">Fine:</span> 
					A comic that has been loved and cared for by someone who may have been a novice collector. Very little wear, may have lost some 
					of its cover gloss, have a few chips or wrinkles and have a slightly off center or rolled cover. Yellowing may have begun to creep 
					into the interior pages. Fine comics sell for about 40-60% of near-mint value.</p>

					<p><span class="heading">Very-Fine:</span> 
					A comic that has been better cared for than its "fair" cousin. Slight read-wear and few defects. Stress around staples may be 
					visible, but not severe enough to cause wrinkles. Cover and pages are crisp and sharp, no flaking or creases. Interior pages 
					may be slightly yellowed in older comics of this condition. Newer very-fine comics sell for about 60-85%, and older comics may 
					sell for as high as 90% of near-mint value.</p>

					<p><span class="heading">Near-Mint:</span>
					I'm almost mint and most people wouldn't know the difference. This is the benchmark by which all other comics are graded and 
					the most common condition for new comics. Cover and pages are bright, clean and have no defects. Slight stress lines may exist 
					near staples and minor printing defects may exist. This is a perfect ten and holds 100% of its value.</p>

					<p><span class="heading">Mint:</span> 
					These comics turn the volume up to eleven. Better than the best and therefore the most uncommon condition in new and old comics. 			
					There are no imperfections and the printing press quality is uniquely superb. This condition is so rare, that it is hardly ever 
					seen, and therefore sells for as high as 120% of near-mint value.</p>				
			
			<span id="c3"></span>
				<p><span class="heading">Grading Tips:</span> 
					Comics, as with many collectibles, are graded on a scale from poor to  mint quality. Granted, the grading of any item can be 
					subjective, but comic books have been around long enough that collectors generally agree upon a definition of what makes a quality 
					comic. In some cases with older comics, they are often allowed a little more leeway on the positive side when it comes to 
					grading.</p>
				
					<p>Things you should look at with first glance are the cover and spine. Is the cover soiled, ripped, rough, dull, water damaged 
					or generally unattractive? Is the spine bent, creased, rolled, are the staples rusted or missing? First impressions can tell you 
					quite a bit about the quality, and you can judge a book by its cover. If the cover appears to be fine, check the centerfold next. 
					Often a comic's pages will come loose from the staples starting with the centerfold. If you find no problems here, then perform 
					a page to page check insuring that the pages are all intact and that there have not been any coupons clipped or pages embellished 
					with ink or markers by an aspiring artist.</p>
				
					<p>The rarest and most insidious flaw to watch for is restoration. There are a variety of tricks that people use both legitimate 
					and illegitimate to improve the condition of a comic, but in some cases the restoration causes the comic more damage than it would 
					have had otherwise. An example I have seen was when someone used black permanent marker to fill in a dark area on a cover that had 
					become faded. It would have not been easily noticed if the marker had not bled through the cover and onto several pages of the 			
					comic. They accomplished the feat of turning what would have been a fine comic into a fair or good comic.</p>
						
					<p>Restored comics are acceptable, as long as the seller makes you aware of the restoration, otherwise it's fraud.</p>							
					
			<span id="c4"></span>
				<p><span class="heading">Professional Grading:</span> 
					In recent years there has been a trend to have professionals grade high-end older comics and newer comics that are speculated to 
					rapidly rise in value.  The best known and most reputable grader is 
					<a href="http://www.cgccomics.com" target="_blank">Comics Guarantee, LLC</a> which is an independent member of the Certified 
					Collectibles Group of companies. Their grading scale ranges from worst (.5) to best(10).  As part of the process, the comic is 
					sealed in a hard plastic case showing the front and back, with the issue and grade notes printed at the top of the case. CGC-graded 
					comics have been known to earn twice the value of non-graded comics.</p>
					
					<p>In my opinion this process seems to defeat the main joy of comics, which is reading. If you purchase a certified graded comic 
					and remove it from the plastic case, then it is no longer certified. This process seems to be better served for items like sports 			
					cards and coins, which still can be enjoyed because of their two dimensional nature. I would only recommend purchasing a "slabbed" 
					comic, or having a comic professionally graded and slabbed if you intend it for investment purposes only.</p>

				<p><span class="title">Buying</span></p>
					<p>Although comics are no longer commonly found at drugstores, groceries and newsstands, there are a multitude of retailers 
					both "brick and mortar" and online.</p>

					<p>To start out, I would like to define three terms which will occur in this portion of the column. 
					<em>Comics</em> go without explaining, but for the sorely uninitiated they are small magazines which are commonly bound by two 
					staples. <em>Graphic novels</em> are less strict by definition, but are typically new comics material printed within a hardbound 
					or over-sized publication. <em>Trade paperbacks</em> are reprinted material usually softbound, but occasionally hardbound, and 
					usually combine a popular story arc or rare time period of an established comic in a more affordable format.</p>

					<p>New comics, graphic novels and trade paperbacks can be commonly found at your local comics shop, a multitude of online services 
					or occasionally retail book stores. Graphic novels and trade paperbacks almost always can be found at retail book stores such as a 
					Barnes and Noble, ordered from an online retailer, such as <a href="http://amazon.com" target="_blank">Amazon.com</a>, or 
					checked-out at your local library.</p>
					
					<p>Back issue comics can be purchased at most comic shops, through Internet auctions services such as  
					<a href="http://ebay.com" target="_blank">eBay.com</a>, from individual sellers advertising in newspaper classifieds or 
					<a href="http://www.craigslist.org" target="_blank">craigslist</a>, and vendors selling comics at conventions, which occur in any 
					number of cities monthly. There are also a number of comics retailers 
					that catalog back issues though online stores. Many of these online retailers also purchase comics for their inventory. You can 
					find a want list for back issue comics being purchased by <a href="http://www.mycomicshop.com" target="_blank">Lone Star Comics</a>.</p>

					<p>As with anything, you should be cautious of who you buy from, the seller's definition of near-mint may be dubious, and once 			
					you find a reputable source; as with a barber, banker or Chinese restaurant, once you find a good one, you should stick with them. 
					That being said, I will give a break down of the different outlets I have used to purchase comics, what they have to offer, and what you can 
					often expect.</p>		
			
			<span id="d2"></span>
				<p><span class="heading">Comics Shops:</span> As their name implies this is a great place to find both new and back issue comics. 
					The character of each shop is surely unique. Some are as neat as a hospital, well organized, have professional and courteous 
					employees and carry a multitude of products other than comics. Some are as messy as a teenager's room, have employees that are 
					surly or rude and may only carry comics, but as such have many hidden treasures.</p>
				
					<p>My local comic shop fits the first description, and although it lacks character it serves my needs, but I  do enjoy the quirky 
					shops to an extent. The oddest comic shop I have ever  been into doubled as a gun shop. I asked the owner/operator what inspired 
					him to couple guns and comics, his response was that he liked them both and  thought there were others out there that shared his 
					passions. Be that as it may, he frightened me and I never returned. Another "odd-ball" shop  that I frequented was stuffed to the 
					gills with comics to the point that it was a fire hazard. I often wondered if the proprietor, who had been there for over 20 years, 
					had any idea, or care, for what was in his shop. He had  premium comics for sale pinned in bags and displayed on his wall, some of which 
					were being faded by sunlight coming through his storefront. Normally this type of sin would cause me to claim heresy and have the 			
					proprietor burned at the stake, using his abused comics as kindling, but at the same time he had some of the best prices on new and 			
					used comics. Buy four comics get the fifth one free and 90% off overstock back issues. I picked up a copy of <em>Captain America</em> 
					#104 (1968) in very-fine condition for $2.50. A bargain at four times the price.</p>			
			
			<span id="d3"></span>
				<p><span class="heading">Mail Order:</span> Shut-ins... this is one was made for you. Home delivery is a convenient and often less 
					expensive means of purchasing your comics, and the sun will never kiss your pasty skin.</p>
					
					<p>I have used, and can recommend, the online services <a href="http://westfieldcomics.com" target="_blank">Worlds of Westfield</a> and 
					<a href="http://www.dcbservice.com/" target="_blank">Discount Comic Book Service</a>.</p>
						
					<p>Publisher-direct subscriptions can also be processed via online through most publishers' websites. I have never used this 			
					method and can not recommend it one way or the other, but their rates are generally cheaper than any other mail-order service.</p>				
			
			<span id="d4"></span>
				<p><span class="heading">Online Auctions:</span> 
					The first thing I can say about online auctions is BUYER BEWARE.  Granted I have found some bargains on the Internet, 					
					but if you balance it against the times I received comics in a condition other than advertised, or when I had to track a guy down for 
					a month to get my comics, it just isn't worth the grief. It's the wild-wild west on the web, and I don't like getting shot.</p>				
			
			<span id="d5"></span>
				<p><span class="heading">Person to Person:</span> These are the rarest of exchanges, but can be the most rewarding.</p>
					
					<p>Any given week you may find ads selling comics in the classified section of you local newspaper or 
					<a href="https://www.craigslist.org" target="_blank">craigslist</a>. Often people selling comics through the newspaper do not 
					know anything about comics, and fall into two camps. The first camp thinks their comics are worth a fortune, but the comics are 
					for the most part crap. I refer back to my first lesson concerning grade: condition, condition, condition. I generally walk away 
					from these exchanges, but give them my phone number in case they change their mind, which they very often do after taking a sample 
					of their "treasure" to a local comic shop. The second camp just wants to unload their (or their speculator cousin's) comics and 
					are willing to take 25 cents for each comic. You may have to pick through a pile of coal to find the diamonds, but it's usually 
					worth it.</p>
					
					<p>An even rarer exchange is when you find someone who has collected for a number of years and is desperate to sell. This leads 
					into another story. I was working on a contract and got to talking to one of the computer techs about comics, when he revealed 
					that he had an extensive collection he wanted to unload. Cautiously intrigued I went to his home to investigate what he was 
					offering. He was kind enough to have a sample of comics ready when I arrived, and let me say, everyone of them was a gem. 
					Then he lead me to the basement (In retrospect that sentence sounds scarier than it should.) This guy could have opened his own 
					comic shop. I took a paper grocery bag full with me to further inspect the comics and would make him an offer at a later date. 
					The comics I inspected were mostly silver-age Marvel comics in fine or better condition, plus one golden-age comic in near-mint 
					condition. After I had calculated the cost of the comics I came up with a total of around $3000 (1998 dollars). Well - being the kind of 
					guy who is always willing to stretch the boundaries of the buyer/seller relationship, I told him that I was going to start the bidding low 
					and we would haggle from there, fully expecting him to counter in the spirit of economic exchange or scoff and stomp off. I opened 			
					the bid at $250, less than the guide value of the golden-age comic. To my surprise he jumped at the offer. Sold! Now, I'm not saying 
					that this may ever happen to you, but the lesson is, if you ever find yourself in the position of controlling the price, go for it.</p>
				
			<span id="d6"></span>
				<p><span class="heading">Convention Deals:</span> 
					Bargains, bargains, bargains, but be sure to shop around. There are always dealers at conventions that are getting out of the 
					business or have overstock and want to get a return on their investment. Quarter boxes (or more commonly now fifty-cent boxes) 
					abound, and if you see a comic you want priced at market value, move on, you're sure to find the same comic or one just as good 
					at a below-market-value price.</p>

				<p><span class="title">Selling</span></p>
					<p>Needless to say, buying comics is a lot easier than selling them. As I briefly mentioned in the buying section you can purchase 						
					comics from "brick and mortar" and online comic shops, online auctions, and individuals. Well guess what? You can sell them back through 
					most of the places you bought them, but the return on your investment may not be what you expect.</p>
			
			<span id="e2"></span>
				<p><span class="heading">Comic Shops:</span> Most comic shops purchase comics for about 25 cents on the dollar. If you have a 
					comic with the market value of $10, you can expect $2.50. This on the surface may seem unfair, but the comics dealer is in the 
					business to make money, not run a geek charity. When they buy your comics they need to make a profit and as such must buy low 
					and sell high, they are also taking a gamble on your comics because there isn't any guarantee they will be able to sell them at 
					a later date for the market value at the time of purchase, or ever.</p>
					
					<p> One advantage to selling to a comics shop is that many will give you store credit in trade - often double what they would 
					pay in cash. It may not be the best deal to you, but it may be the quickest.</p>			
			
					<p>Another option that comics shops may offer is selling on consignment. This means that they give your comic a place in their shop 
					where potential customers have an opportunity to purchase it, and the store takes a modest cut of the sale.</p>
			
			<span id="e3"></span>
				<p><span class="heading">Online Auctions:</span> A better return on your investment would be through an online auction service 
					such as <a href="http://ebay.com" target="_blank">eBay.com</a>. The only economic disadvantage to both buyer and seller is the 
					expense of shipping and the fees that online services now charge. <em>Oh for the days when online auctions were free. So long!</em> 
					You can also now receive instant payment through <a href="https://www.paypal.com" target="_blank">PayPal</a>, but they like their 
					owner eBay, will take a portion of your sale.</p>
					
					<p>The first rule of online auctions is always be honest with your customer about shipping. Many people get kind of ticked-off 
					if you charge them double your actual shipping cost, and they will know, because the rate is on the stamp. For the best deal, 
					ship your comics <a href="https://about.usps.com/notices/not121/not121_tech.htm" target="_blank">media mail</a>  through the 
					<a href="http://usps.com" target="_blank">U.S. Postal Service</a>. The post office charges by the pound for media mail and you 
					can use your bathroom scale to get an approximate weight. In the past you could use the post office website to determine the cost 
					and then contact your seller with the final bill, but much of this process has been integrated into eBay's auction system.</p>
					
					<p>The second rule is pack your comics professionally. To ensure they get there in one piece, I place the bagged and boarded comics 
					inside a larger plastic bag. Two Ziploc gallon size freezer bags pulled over both ends and wrapped with packing tape around the 
					center on the X and Y axis will make a snug and reasonably waterproof seal. As a little cheat, I recommend using the post office's 
					Priority Mail boxes by turning them inside out and taping them back together again. Technically you are not supposed to do this, 
					but most postal workers could care less. BTW, if you find yourself in the federal penitentiary for mail fraud, I don't know you.</p>

					<p>The third rule when selling online is be honest with your customer about the condition of the product, it may be counter 
					intuitive, but talk the product down a little, after all you are asking for someone to purchase a product sight unseen. In the 			
					end, if you establish a bad reputation as a seller, you are very unlikely to sell to anyone every again. eBay now requires that all 								
					auctions have an image of the item posted, but this shouldn't be much of hassle for anyone with a digital camera or a smartphone.</p>				
			
			<span id="e4"></span>
				<p><span class="heading">Person to Person:</span> 
					This method may have the greatest return on your investment. In the past unless you had a buyer ready to go, you had to make the 
					upfront investment of a newspaper classified advertisement. Today you can post your comics on craigslist for the low, low price of free. 
					Although, if an interested party contacts you, you should to ask yourself: Would I want someone like me knowing where I live? In the end, 
					you may get lucky, this model citizen may want to buy everything you're offering and then some... or just want to stuff you in a trash can. 
					I recommend meeting in a public place such as a grocery store or library parking lot, better safe than have your picture on the side of a 
					milk carton.</p>

				<span id="f1"></span>
					<p><span class="title">Pop-Culture Conventions</span></p>						
						<p>As I previously wrote, conventions are a bargain for comics; but also have so much more to offer. You will find original art, 
						toys, movies, posters and apparel for sale. You will find movie screenings for films you would never otherwise see. There are 
						conferences with professionals speaking about the  comics business; booths with professionals reviewing artwork and scripts, 				
						drawing sketches, signing comics, or just shooting the breeze with fans. There is always plenty to see and do, and chances are 
						there is a convention, even a small one, somewhere 
						<a href="http://www.conventionscene.com/schedules/comicbookconventions/" target="_blank">near you</a> on any given month.</p>
				
				<span id="f2"></span>
					<p><span class="heading">Publisher Booths:</span> 
						Publishers big and small always  have booths at the big conventions to advertise their products, give the fans an opportunity 
						to meet the creators of their favorite comics, and give budding creators an opportunity to have their work critiqued.</p>
						
						<p>A few rules should be adhered to when meeting your favorite or not-so-favorite creators.</p>

					<p><span class="heading">First:</span> Be polite, even if the writer/artist "ruined" your favorite character, get a grip, its 
						only a comic-book character, and eventually the publisher will get enough negative correspondence, or the sales will dip low enough, 
						that they will get a new creative team on the book.</p>
						
					<p><span class="heading">Second:</span> Be polite, if your favorite creator is having a conversation with another creator, or 
						fan, or a lamppost, then do not interrupt, or hang around making them feel like they have their own personal psycho stalker.</p>
						
					<p><span class="heading">Third:</span> Be polite and humble. If you are showing a creator your script and or art  then take criticism as it 
						is intended, which is to help you be a better writer or artist. A rising tide lifts all ships and professionals want to work with 
						other people of professional caliber. Criticism may seem personal at the time, and it may be, but don't take it that way and storm off. 
						You may have to work with this person someday.</p>
				
				<span id="f3"></span>
					<p><span class="heading">Autographs:</span> Creators are always scheduled to do autographs. The same rules of politeness apply
						as with the publisher booths.</p>
					
						<p>There are also a few other rules you may want to observe.</p>
					
					<p><span class="heading">First:</span> If you want a creator to sign your comics, don't bring every issue of their work you own. 
						I generally bring about 3-4 books for several creators to sign. Conventions are busy places with long, long lines and there is no guarantee 
						you will even get one autograph, so hedge your bets.</p>
					
					<p><span class="heading">Second:</span> Before you hand over your comics, let them know how you would like them to autograph it. 
						In recent years many creators have been signing the covers of the comics in silver paint pen, which I personally do not 
						care for. My preference is to have them sign in regular ink, beside their name on the page that credits the creators.</p>

						<p>As an aside, there is much debate about autographs and the condition of comics. Some claim that it lowers the grade and value, 
						but others claim that it adds value. As far as I'm concerned it only adds value if I got the autograph myself, and that's the kind 
						of value which you can't attach a price.</p>

					<p><span class="heading">Third:</span> If you want an autograph, offer a copy that is in nice condition. Granted, you may not be 
						able to find a golden-age comic that you can afford in pristine condition, but don't offer a creator an otherwise affordable 
						comic with its cover missing and poop streaks on it.</p>
					
					<p><span class="heading">Forth:</span> Perhaps the most important rule, if you want a creator to autograph a comic, make sure they 
						had something to do with it beyond working for the publisher. Comic books published as far back as the early 1960's generally have 				
						credits listed for the creators of the comic, read them before you offer it to be autographed. If the comic does not list the creators, 
						you may possibly find this information in the price-guide books I mentioned in the <a href="#c1">Grading and Condition</a> section.</p>
						
				<span id="f4"></span>
					<p><span class="heading">Artist Alley:</span> 
						Along with established creators, you can usually find lesser known artists looking to make a buck and get their talents recognized 
						creating original artwork. As with all collectibles the price is always up for debate, and I encourage you to at least give haggling 
						a respectful attempt and save yourself some money to buy more comics.</p>

				<span id="g1"></span>
					<p><span class="title">What is Spider-Bob Reading? <em>(And why should you care?)</em></span></p>				
					
					<p>I have been reading and collecting comics for almost 30 years (No, I don't live in my parents' basement, I live under a bridge.), and have 
					read a lot of treasure and a lot of trash. Here are a few thoughts and suggestions on reading comics.</p>					
				
				<span id="g2"></span>
					<p><span class="heading">Large Publishers:</span> 
						Most of the comics I have read were created by the two large publishers; DC and Marvel Comics. The reason for this is that they not only 
						produce more comics than all the other publishers combined (a slight exaggeration), but as a rule produce better quality comics, 				
						both in content and materials (perhaps another slight exaggeration). These two companies have both existed for over 75 years and 
						would not have lasted this long if they didn't create quality comics.</p>
					
				<span id="g3"></span>
					<p><span class="heading">Small & Independent Publishers:</span> 
						The definition of a small or independent publisher is usually understood as other than the big two, regardless of size. There are 
						hundreds of comic-book publishers on all corners of the Earth, offering all types of styles and stories for all types of taste. 
						Occasionally one of these titles catches my eye on the comics' display at my local shop, but often it's a gamble on a product which may be 
						treasure, trash, or simply not around in a few months.</p>
						
						<p>One independent title that I read religiously for years was <em>Cerebus</em> by Canadian creator-owned publisher Aardvark-Vanaheim. 
						The black-and-white comic was written, draw and self-published by Dave Sim since 1977, and follows the adventures of the anthropomorphic 
						aardvark named Cerebus. The title started as a Conan the Barbarian parody, but evolved into an intelligent thesis on philosophy, religion, 
						politics and every other topic of social or moral significance. The series ended with issue 300, and I would warn against attempting to collect 						
						all the original comics, instead collect the trade paperbacks, affectionately known as phone books due to their size.</p>

				<span id="g4"></span>
					<p><span class="heading">Limited Series:</span>
						Due to the nature of limited series, it's difficult to recommend them, because by the time I do, they may be out of print and unavailable.</p>

				<span id="g5"></span>
					<p><span class="heading">Trades and Back Issues:</span>
						To ensure that I have plenty of reading material, in case it's a lean week for new comics, I keep plenty of trade paperbacks and 
						back issues of inexpensive comics on hand.</p>
						
						<p>The trades I recommend on a budget are the <em>Marvel Essentials</em>, which collect the early issues of their most popular 
						titles in an inexpensive black and white format. If you have the money, I recommend the <em>Marvel Omnibus</em> collections, 
						which are printed on high-quality glossy paper and well worth the money if you get them for half the price through an online seller like 
						<a target="_blank" href="http://www.dcbservice.com/">Discount Comic Book Service</a>. The stories are kind of goofy compared to 
						the sophisticated writing of today, but Stan Lee and his small staff were cranking out over a dozen books back then. If you're a fan 
						of Marvel Comics, and want to learn more about the history of your favorite characters I recommend checking them out in either format.</p>

						<p>For bulk inexpensive back issues the best way I've found to purchase them is through online auctions.  I know this may 
						contradict my advice concerning the quality of online auctions, but when I am buying 25+ comics for less than $10, it's worth 
						a chance the merchandise isn't in tip-top shape.</p>
						
						<p>Most of the old books I look for are failed series from the 1970s and 80s that most likely will never be collected in a a trade. Many 
						of these books are not the  best stories ever published and I'm sure they were canceled for a reason, but they do have an endearing 
						kitsch, and they make for a reasonably enjoyable read on a lazy afternoon.</p>
						
						<p><span class="heading">This is The End My Friend:</span>
						Well,this is the end of the column, I hope that it has been beneficial. If you have any questions about a topic I covered, or 
						didn't cover, feel free to contact me through my <a href="https://www.facebook.com/spiderbobforum" target="_blank">facebook forum</a>.</p>
