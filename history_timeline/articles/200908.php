<p><span>The Walt Disney Corporation</span> announced its intent to purchase Marvel Comics for $4 billion, on 
			August 31, 2009.</p><br />

			<p>This was not the first instance of a comic book publisher attracting the attention of a larger company. DC Comics 
			had been owned by a company that, through a series of mergers and acquisitions dating back to 1967, would eventually 
			become the media empire Time Warner. DC Comics was originally acquired by the Kinney National Company, a merger 
			created when Kinney Parking Company, a New Jersey parking lot company with ties to the mafia, and National Cleaning 
			Company combined. Kinney set its sights on several movie studios including Warner Brothers-Seven Arts, which would 
			later be known as Warner Communications and then eventually Time Warner.</p><br />  

			<p>In the late 1990's Marvel Comic's movie studio, Marvel Studios, had aggressively licensed its properties to 
			larger movie producers, including Sony who produced a trilogy of Spider-Man movies, and 20<sup>th</sup> Century Fox 
			who produced a trilogy of X-Men movies. With the cinematic successes of their characters well established, Marvel 
			Studios began producing movies on its own, beginning with <em>Iron Man</em> and <em>The Incredible Hulk</em> in 2008. 
			Marvel's new found profitability in movie production attracted the Walt Disney Corporation, which could offer the fledgling 
			studio greater distribution, marketing and access to cash for movie projects.</p><br />
