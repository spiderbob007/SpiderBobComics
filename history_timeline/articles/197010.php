<p><span><em>Conan the Barbarian</em> #1</span> (Oct. 1970) featured the first comic book appearance of

			day be made king by his own hand.</p><br />
			
			<p>Conan is the most famous creation of 1930's era pulp fiction writer Robert E. Howard. The epic tales of the 
			barbarian from the mythical land of Cimmeria were first published in <em>Weird Tales</em> (Dec. 1932). Conan would 
			see print an additional twenty-five times until the death of the character's creator by suicide in 1936. Although there were a handful 
			of stories printed posthumously, Conan's story would not continue until Marvel Comics' writer Roy Thomas brought him 
			to the pages of a comic book. Conan proved successful enough that the publisher added two more mature black-and-white 
			magazines titled <em>Savage Tales</em> (May, 1971) and <em>Savage Sword of Conan</em> (Aug. 1974), as well as another 
			comic titled <em>King Conan</em> (March, 1980).</p><br />
