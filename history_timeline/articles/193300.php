<p><span><em>Famous Funnies a carnival of comics</em></span>, a 36-page one-issue-only comic book published in 1933
			by Eastern Color Printing and Dell Comics and distributed by Woolworth's department stores. <em>Famous Funnies </em>
			is considered by historians to be the first true American comic book.</p><br />
					
			<p>Before <em>Famous Funnies </em> most "comic books" were similar to Sunday newspaper comic pages, without the newspaper.
			Some of the early comic books published original material, but most were a repackaging of material previously 
			published by newspapers, and often given away as promotional items.</p><br />
					
			<p>It is uncertain as to whether <em>Famous Funnies </em> was sold or given away by Woolworth's, but when the first newsstand
			issue appeared in July, 1934, the now 68-page comic sold for 10 cents.</p><br />
