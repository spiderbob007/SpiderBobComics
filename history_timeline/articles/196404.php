<p><span><em>Daredevil the Man Without Fear!</em> #1</span> (April, 1964) featured the first comic book appearance of 
			<a href="../heroes/marvel/Daredevil.php" target="_blank">Daredevil</a>, a blind attorney who battles crime in the courts by day and 
			in the streets by night.</p><br />

			<p>Young Matt Murdock was blinded by a radioactive isotope that fell from a truck that was illegally transporting 
			the substance through his New York City "Hell's Kitchen" neighborhood. Pushing to safety a blind man crossing in front of 
			the truck, Murdock was blinded by the radiation, but it granted him heightened senses and a form of radar which allows him to 
			perceive objects in a 360-degree radius.</p><br />

			<p>Murdock's father was a professional boxer who insisted that his son use his mind instead of his fists. Despite his 
			"disability" the young Murdock became an attorney not long before his father was killed by mobsters for refusing to 
			throw a boxing match. Donning a costume similar to a boxer, Murdock uses his abilities for retribution and justice.</p><br />
