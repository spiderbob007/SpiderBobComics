<p><span>Marvel goes digital.</span></p><br />

			<p>Soon after the rapid expansion of the Internet in the mid-1990's, Marvel Comics attempted a foray into the digital 
			comics market, but the offerings were meager and Marvel's main website was often plagued by code errors and low quality 
			images.</p><br />
					
			<p>Re-launching the endeavor in November of 2007, <span>Marvel Digital Comics Unlimited</span> offered a yearly subscription 
			for a flat fee. Thousands of titles that span from current comics all the way back to the publisher's origins in 1939 are available. 
			To entice readers to subscribe, Marvel offers a weekly sampling of free digital comics both contemporary and classic.</p><br />
					
			<p>Marvel eventually made it possible to read digital comics on mobile devices instead of just on a computer.</p><br />
