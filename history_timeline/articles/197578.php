<p><span>The "DC Implosion"</span> is a mocking appellation attached to the mid-1970's marketing campaign to recapture 
			market share from the publisher's chief rival Marvel Comics.</p><br />

			<p>The strategy marketed as the "DC Explosion" increased the number of comics being published an additional 57 titles by reviving comics 
			that	had been canceled in the late 1960's and early 1970's as well as creating a multitude of new books. The increase in variety was also 
			coupled with an increase in the number of pages with backup stories, and an increase in cover prices; some to as much as $1 (a small fortune 
			to children of the 1970s). Marvel Comics had exercised a strategy of market dominance by publishing a multitude of comics in different genres, 
			and DC sought to battle against their competitor by using similar tactics, but the results were disastrous.</p><br />
					
			<p>Increases in production costs due to inflation and a national economic recession, coupled with lagging readership, and the winter snow 
			blizzards of 1977 and 1978 caused the entire industry to take a downturn. DC's executives decided the only course of action would be to cancel 
			under-performing titles. Sixty-five titles were canceled by 1978, including the company's flagship title and its namesake 
			<em><b>D</b>etective <b>C</b>omics</em>. To rescue <em>Detective Comics</em>, which at this point was only being published six times a 
			year on a bi-monthly schedule, the comic was re-branded with the sub-title "<em>Starring the Batman Family</em>". To save 
			<em>Detective Comics</em>, a title which had be waning for years, the more popular and better selling <em>Batman Family</em> 
			had to be sacrificed.</p><br />

			<p>In the aftermath of the cancellations, the DC staff collected the material of unpublished issues and distributed 
			them to the creators as two black-and-white photocopy editions titled <em>Canceled Comic Cavalcade</em>, as proof  of ownership 
			to the U.S. copyright office.</p><br />
