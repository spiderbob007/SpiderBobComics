<p><span><em>Motion Picture Funnies Weekly</em> #1</span>, (April, 1939) a black and white promotional give-away intended to be distributed 
			at movie theaters by the Funnies Incorporated studio featured the first appearance of 
			the <a href="../heroes/marvel/SubMariner.php" target="_blank">Sub-Mariner</a>. 
			The project was aborted before publication, and the seven of only eight samples created to be sent to theater 
			owners were discovered decades later in the estate of publisher Lloyd Jacquet in 1974.</p><br />
