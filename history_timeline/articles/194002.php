<p><span><em>Whiz Comics</em> #2</span> (February, 1940) featured the first appearance of 
			<a href="../heroes/dc/CaptainMarvel.php" target="_blank">Captain Marvel</a>, an orphan boy named Billy Batson, who, when he utters 
			the magic word "SHAZAM!" is transformed into an adult with the powers of the ancient gods.</p><br />

			<p>Although Captain Marvel was intended to appear in issue #1 of <em>Whiz Comics</em>, the first four issues 
			of this title are mis-numbered, resulting in the first issue being #2.</p><br />

			<p>National Periodicals (DC Comics) sued Fawcett Publications in the 1940's, claiming Captain Marvel, infringed 
			upon National's copyright for the character  <a href="../heroes/dc/Superman.php" target="_blank">Superman</a>. By the time the 
			trials and appeals had played themselves out in the courts, the comics market had taken a downturn and Fawcett 
			was forced to settle. Fawcett agreed to cease publishing Captain Marvel and sold their remaining characters to 
			Charlton Comics. Decades later DC Comics would lease and eventually purchase the rights to Captain Marvel. 
			Eventually it would also acquire the other Fawcett characters when it purchased Charlton Comics.</p><br />
