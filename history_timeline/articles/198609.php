<p><span><em>Watchmen</em> #1</span> (Sept, 1986) introduced readers to a universe that realistically depicted a world with 
			costumed vigilantes and superhumans.</p><br />

			<p>A twelve-issue limited series, intended to both critique American culture in the 1980's, as well as the superhero 
			genre itself, <em>Watchmen</em> explores the consequences of a world where masked vigilantes and one immensely 
			powerful superhuman had existed since the 1940s. The characters were dark and damaged, and exhibited traits of sadism, 
			self-loathing and doubt. The most powerful among the heroes is Dr. Manhattan, a man who was destroyed by nuclear 
			science, and rebuilds himself an atom at a time, until he achieves godhood, but at the price of his humanity.</p><br />
			
			<p>Most of the characters in the Watchmen were analogous to characters once owned by defunct comics' publisher Charlton 
			Comics, which DC Comics had purchased in 1983. Writer, Alan Moore, wanted to use Charlton's characters, but because 
			of the dystopian conclusion of the story, DC's editorial staff and management believed that the characters would be 
			deemed damaged merchandise and unusable for future stories. Moore instead created new characters with similar 
			abilities and motifs to those from Charlton.</p><br />
