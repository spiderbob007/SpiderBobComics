<p>It's befitting that the foundation for DC Comics' <span>"The New 52"</span> should be introduced by the same 
			character that heralded the return of superhero comics at the publisher in 1956 with 
			<a href="../issues/dc/1stFlashII.php" target="_blank"><em>Showcase</em> #4</a>. The <a href="../heroes/dc/FlashII.php" target="_blank">Flash</a>, 
			in the pages of the limited series <em>Flashpoint</em> (May, 2011), encounters events that rewrite the history of 
			the DC Universe and sweep away most of the continuity of the previous decades.</p><br>

			<p>Why the reboot?</p><br> 

			<p>Losing market share to Marvel Comics, both in print and the digital comics market, and spurred to action by Marvel's recent acquisition 
			by the Walt Disney Corporation, DC Comics needed to grab readers' attentions. Hoping to attract young readers who had not been purchasing 
			comics for decades due to growing competition from other media and a general decline in youth reading, DC Comics chose a radical course; 
			cancel every title published and reintroduce its characters with new #1 issues as though the previous continuity did not exist, and couple each 
			issues' sale date with a digital copy available to download for a fee.</p><br>

			<p>Offering a digital copy during the same month as the print version going on sale, worried and upset many comic shop owners. 
			What this move by DC Comics will eventually mean for an industry soon to mature into its first century, only the future knows, but hopefully for the 
			publisher and the industry at large, it will not be another implosion on the magnitude of the failed "DC Explosion" of the 1970s.</p><br />
