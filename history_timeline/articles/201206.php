			<p>When comics were published during the Golden Age of the 1940's, social issues were rarely tackled. In general 
			comics served as government propaganda supporting the war overseas against the Nazi's and Imperialist Japanese. 
			Due to the Comics Code Authority, after 1954 comics were censored, ensuring government and moral authority was never 
			challenged without dire economic consequences for the publisher.</p><br />

			<p>As society changed, comics changed with it, introducing diversity that reflected a culture beyond that of a white 
			Christian mainstream. In a market dominated by Caucasian male characters, starting in the 1960's comics introduced 
			more female lead characters other than <a href="../heroes/dc/WonderWomanI.php" target="_blank">Wonder Woman</a> and 
			<a href="../heroes/dc/SupergirlII.php" target="_blank">Supergirl</a>, and introduced noble heroes of color such as the 
			<a href="../heroes/marvel/BlackPantherI.php" target="_blank">Black Panther</a>, but mainstream comics still refrained from 
			controversies such as the prevailing drug culture and the war in Vietnam.</p><br />

			<p>With the introduction of "Underground Comix" in the 1960's, readers could find protest and counter-culture in 
			comics, but only if they were willing to look beyond their drugstore spinner rack or sidewalk newsstand. By the 
			1980's comics had matured and imprints were created by mainstream publishers to cater to an older comics' reading 
			public. Mature-imprint comics adopted themes of sex and violence formerly only found in black-and-white magazines 
			such as <em>Heavy Metal</em>. These imprints allowed writers greater creativity and an ability to explore taboo themes formerly 
			censored by publishers.</p><br />
			 
			<p>Marvel comics formally introduced its first homosexual character in 1992 in the pages of <em>Alpha Flight</em> #106. 
			There were insinuations by <a href="../teams/marvel/AlphaFlight.php" target="_blank">Alpha Flight</a> creator John Byrne that the 
			Canadian hero, <a href="../heroes/marvel/Northstar.php" target="_blank">Northstar</a>, was gay, but due to censorship fears from 
			the Comics Code Authority, Marvel's editor-in-chief during the 1980's would not allow the character to be explicitly gay. Despite 
			typically low sales for <em>Alpha Flight</em>, issue #106 sold out in a week. Stories from some comics retailers implied anti-gay 
			activists had purchased every issue of the comic in an effort to prevent it being read by the public. Not much was made of 
			Northstar's sexuality after <em>Alpha Flight</em> #106.</p><br />
			
			<p>Gay marriage and the adoption of a child by a gay couple was first depicted in <em>The Authority</em> #29 (July, 2002), a 
			mature readers comic published by DC Comic's Wildstorm imprint. The comic was noted for pushing the boundaries during a 
			time when the publisher was afraid of media scrutiny in the wake of terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. Despite the marriage 
			of Apollo and Midnighter, analogs for Superman and Batman, the comic did not attract overt media scrutiny, but rampant censorship 
			by DC Comic's editorial and management created a rift with the comic's creators leading to delays in publication, which created a rift 
			with fans, leading to its eventual cancellation.</p><br />
			
			<p>Roughly a decade later Marvel would reveal another character as gay, the old-west gunslinger 
			<a href="../heroes/marvel/RawhideKid.php" target="_blank">Rawhide Kid</a>. Contrary to the Johnny Bart's established personality in 
			comics published decades previous, the story depicted the Rawhide Kid as a flamboyant and slightly swishy gunslinger and fighter, 
			capably dealing with rough cowboys and bandits that weren't quite sure what to make of him. The comic was played primarily for laughs and 
			stirred a minor media storm. The most interesting revelation to come out of the Rawhide Kid controversy was made by long-time Marvel 
			Comics writer and editor Stan Lee, when he revealed in a CNN interview that 
			<a href="../teams/marvel/HowlingCommandosI.php" target="_blank">Howling Commandos'</a> platoon member Percy "Pinky" Pinkerton, 
			from the 1960's war comic <em>Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos</em> was also gay.</p><br />
