<p><span><em>Fantastic Four</em> #52</span> (July, 1966) featured the first comic book appearance of the
			<a href="../heroes/marvel/BlackPantherI.php" target="_blank">Black Panther</a>, the king of a technologically advanced African nation, 
			who was granted cat-like abilities from a traditional herbal potion.</p><br />
			
			<p>The Black Panther was the first costumed superhero of color, and his creation apparently has no correlation to, 
			nor was he the inspiration for the naming of the militant self-defense organization the Black Panther Party (BPP), 
			which was founded in Oakland California by Huey P. Newton and Bobby Seale in October of 1966.</p><br />

			<p>The first black non-costumed superhero, Waku: Prince of the Bantu, first appeared in <em>Jungle Tales</em> #1 
			(Sept. 1954) published by Atlas Comics, the precursor to Marvel Comics. During the decade preceding Waku's debut, most 
			comic characters of color were buffoonish. Black and African American characters in particular were depicted 
			with stereotypes common to minstrel shows from the 19<sup>th</sup> Century, where white performers would imitate black 
			people by coloring themselves in "black face" with dark makeup. The Black Panther was depicted as a man of 
			regal bearing who commanded a society that was both ancient in its traditions and modern in its advancements. 
			Black Panther became a supporting character in the <a href="../teams/marvel/FantasticFour.php" target="_blank">Fantastic Four</a>, 
			and a regular member of the <a href="../teams/marvel/Avengers.php" target="_blank">Avengers</a>.</p><br />
