			(1954) by psychiatrist Dr. Fredric Wertham, claimed that comic books were a primary contributor to juvenile delinquency and crime in 
			America. Dr. Wertham claimed that comics contained subtext of homosexuality and fascism. His assertions caused a moral panic resulting 
			in congressional hearings and the comics publishing industry creating a self-censorship board known as the Comics Code Authority, which 
			mostly followed standards established by the 1930 Hollywood Production Code.</p><br />

			<p>Comics approved by the Comics Code Authority carried a seal of approval prominently printed on the cover. 
			The Comics Code broadly prohibited unflattering depictions of public and moral authorities, gruesome crime, 
			drug and alcohol use, and "sexual perversion," and specifically prohibited vampires, werewolves, ghouls, zombies, 
			and the use of the words "horror" or "terror" in the titles, and placed numerous restrictions upon the use of 
			the word "crime." It also required that heroes and villains be clearly identified and that good always triumphed 
			over evil. Essentially, the Comics Code Authority's restrictions were designed to put EC Comics out of business, 
			resulting in the publisher refocusing its efforts into <em>MAD Magazine</em>, which due to its magazine format was 
			exempt from CCA censorship.</p><br />

			<p>A notorious charge against the Comics Code Authority was that it was racist, supported by an incident in which
			a story titled "Judgement Day"; which had been previously published in 1953 before the CCA's formation was not
			approved by the CCA in reprint because the protagonist was an astronaut who in the last panel was revealed to 
			be a black man.</p><br />

			<p>Other less insidious, but equally ridiculous incidents involved the censorship of comic author Marv Wolfman's last name because 
			it happened to be "Wolfman," and the disapproval of a story involving the dangers of drug addiction. The second incident 
			occurred when Marvel Editor-in-Chief Stan Lee was approached by the US Department of Health, Education and Welfare 
			about publishing a comic on the dangers of drug abuse. Stan Lee wrote a three-part story for <em>Amazing Spider-Man</em> 
			in which a friend of Peter Parker (Spider-Man's true identity) became addicted to prescription drugs. The CCA refused 
			to approve the story, prompting Lee to publish <em>Amazing Spider-Man</em> #96-98 (May-July, 1971) without the Comics 
			Code seal.</p><br />

			<p>Although the Comics Code Authority has been revised numerous times over the decades to allow greater creativity, 
			many independent publishers never sought the CCA's approval and eventually the two largest publishers, Marvel and DC 
			Comics, abandoned the code, with Archie Comics following suit as the last comics company to carry the seal, effectively 
			ending the Comics Code Authority's half-century of censorship.</p><br />
