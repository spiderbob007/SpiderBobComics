<p><span><em>Hadashi no Gen</em></span> translated into English as <em>Barefoot Gen</em> is considered to be 
			the first attempt at bringing Japanese comics to the United States. The story is an autobiographical account of the 
			author's survival of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima, Japan on August 6, 1945, which is estimated to have killed up to 166,000 people.</p><br />

			<p>The tradition of comics, or as it is known in Japan "manga," goes back to the first manga magazine <em>Eshinbun 
			Nipponchi</em> published in 1874. Manga became more Americanized after World War II, when American comics were imported 
			by American soldiers during the United States' occupation of Japan after the war. First among the post-war manga was 
			<em>Osamu Tezuka</em> (Astro Boy), which remains popular both in Japan and abroad.</p><br />

			<p>In Japan, manga is serialized in black-and-white magazines. Beginning in the 1970's manga began showing up in America, mostly 
			in comic shops near college campuses. As word spread and comics' readers showed interest, mostly American small publishers, such 
			as Eclipse Comics and Dark Horse Comics, began reprinting manga titles translated into English in a traditional American comics format 
			during the mid-1980's. Epic Comics, an imprint of Marvel Comics, published a prestige format colorized translation of <em>Akira</em>, 
			considered a classic of the manga art form. Epic Comics was shut down when its parent company Marvel Comics experienced financial 
			difficulties and the series was completed by independent publisher Dark Horse.</p><br />
