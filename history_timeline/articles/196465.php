<p>Beginning in the mid-1960s and becoming obsolete by the mid-1970s, after a loosening of the Comic Code freed American publishers 
			to exercise greater creativity as well as more explicit material from Europe becoming available in titles like 
			<em>Heavy Metal</em>, <span>Underground "comix"</span> were small press or self-published comics which addressed issues 
			that the Comics Code Authority restricted, not to mention they were often violent, sexually explicit and depicted drug use... 
			lots and lots of drug use.</p><br />

			<p>The tradition of the underground comic goes back to "Tijuana bibles," pornographic parodies of famous comic-strip 
			characters first seen in the 1920s, that were falsely rumored to have been manufactured and smuggled from 
			Mexico and typically sold in an "under the counter" manner. Underground comic books were sold primarily to young 
			people who frequented "head shops," businesses that sold drug paraphernalia, primarily to users of marijuana.</p><br />

			<p>The first underground comix were produced in the early 1960's as a counter-culture response to mainstream comic 
			books. The comic, which is considered by many collectors to be the first underground comic, was a compilation of 
			<em>The Adventures of Jesus</em> published by University of Texas art graduate Frank Stack under the pseudonym 
			Foolbert Sturgeon. Others would follow, the most famous among them: <em>Fritz the Cat</em>, <em>Mr. Natural</em>, 
			<em>The Fabulously Furry Freak Brothers</em> and <em>Zap Comix</em>.</p><br />
