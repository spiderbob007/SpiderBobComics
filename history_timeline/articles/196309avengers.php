<p><span><em>The Avengers</em> #1</span> (Sept. 1963) featured the teaming of Marvel's less high-profile headliners of the 
			1960's. Chief among the heroes were  <a href="../heroes/marvel/Thor.php" target="_blank">Thor</a>, the Norse god of thunder, 
			the Invincible <a href="../heroes/marvel/IronManI.php" target="_blank">Iron Man</a>, 
			the Incredible <a href="../heroes/marvel/HulkII.php" target="_blank">Hulk</a>, and the size-changing couple, 
			<a href="../heroes/marvel/DrPym.php" target="_blank">Ant-Man</a> and the <a href="../heroes/marvel/Wasp.php" target="_blank">Wasp</a>.</p><br />
			
			<p>Much like writer Stan Lee and artist Jack Kirby's early creation the 
			<a href="../teams/marvel/FantasticFour.php" target="_blank">Fantastic Four</a>, the Avengers interacted with one another in a 
			way that played off of personality conflicts among the heroes. The Hulk defected from and turned against his 
			teammates out of feelings of persecution, because he felt the rest of the team viewed him as a monster. The 
			roster of the title changed early in its run re-introducing 
			<a href="../heroes/marvel/CaptainAmericaI.php" target="_blank">Captain America</a> after almost a decade absence from comics, and 
			integrating characters such as <a href="../heroes/marvel/Hawkeye.php" target="_blank">Hawkeye</a> the outlaw archer, and the mutants 
			<a href="../heroes/marvel/Quicksilver.php" target="_blank">Quicksilver</a> and the 
			<a href="../heroes/marvel/ScarletWitch.php" target="_blank">Scarlet Witch</a>, both formerly members of 
			<a href="../villains/marvel/Magneto.php" target="_blank">Magneto's</a> 
			<a href="../teams/marvel/BrotherhoodMutants.php" target="_blank">Brotherhood of Evil Mutants</a>.</p><br />
