<p><span><em>Amazing Fantasy</em> #15</span> (Aug. 1962) featured the first appearance of 
			<a href="../heroes/marvel/SpiderManI.php" target="_blank">Spider-Man</a>, a scientifically brilliant high school student who gains the 
			abilities of a spider when he is bitten by an arachnid that was exposed to radiation at a laboratory demonstration of 
			nuclear power.</p><br />
			
			<p>Marvel Comic's head writer and Editor-in-Chief, Stan Lee, proposed the character idea of Spider-Man to his publisher, Martin Goodman, 
			but the idea was not approved because Goodman believed spiders were icky and no one would buy the comic. Knowing 
			a winner when he had one, Lee put Spider-Man's origin story in the final issue of a comic that was scheduled to be 
			canceled, <em>Amazing Fantasy</em>.</p><br />

			<p>Spider-Man is the most widely recognized character that is published by Marvel Comics.</p><br />
