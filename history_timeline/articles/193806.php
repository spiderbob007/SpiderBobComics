<p><span><em>Action Comics</em> #1</span> (June, 1938) featured the first appearance of <a href="../heroes/dc/Superman.php" target="_blank">Superman</a>, 
			an alien from the fictitious planet of Krypton, who possessed powers and abilities beyond that of mere mortal men.</p><br />
					
			<p>The invention of writer Jerry Siegel and artist Joe Shuster, Superman first appeared in a self-published fanzine 
			<em>Science Fiction</em> #3 (June, 1933) as a bald-headed telepathic villain in a short story titled "The Reign of the Super-Man."</p><br />
					
			<p>Reworking the character, Siegel and Shuster tried for five years to find a publisher for their superhuman character. 
			After creating the two-fisted detective <a href="../heroes/dc/SlamBradley.php" target="_blank">Slam Bradley</a> for 
			<em>Detective Comics</em> #1 (March, 1937), the creative duo were able to convince National Allied Publications 
			(the predecessor to DC Comics) to publish Superman. The duo earned $130 (accounting for inflation, roughly $2200 
			in 2015 dollars) for their first Superman story.</p><br />
					
			<p>After the successful publication of <em>Action Comics</em> #1, Superman branched into other forms of media, 
			including newspaper comic strips, radio, and eventually motion pictures and television.  Superman was very lucrative 
			for the publisher, and after Siegel and Shuster's 10-year contract ended, the duo took their employer to court seeking 
			what they felt was adequate compensation. Although the publisher settled after the court ruled against them, 
			further lawsuits occurred in the ensuing decades, eventually settled or ruled upon years after the deaths of both 
			of Superman's creators.</p><br />
					
			<p>Although newspaper-strip reprints of the masked jungle adventurer, the <a href="../heroes/indi/Phantom.php" target="_blank">Phantom</a> 
			 appeared in <a href="../issues/indi/1stPhantom.php" target="_blank"><i>Ace Comic</i> #11</a> four months before Superman's debut, 
			 the "Man of Steel" is considered the first costumed superhero and the template for a multitude of comic book superheroes that would later 
			 be created. Publication of <em>Action Comics</em> is considered the beginning of the Golden Age of comic books.</p><br />
