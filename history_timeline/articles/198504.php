<p><span><em>Crisis on Infinite Earths</em> #1</span> (April, 1985) was the beginning of the end of the DC Universe that many longtime 
			comics' fans knew.</p><br>

			<p>The <em>Crisis on Infinite Earths</em> was both an economic and artistic decision designed to breathe new life 
			into the characters of the DC universe, as well as relieve the creative and editorial staff of a burdensome and 
			conflicting continuity accumulated over 45 years.</p><br>

			<p>The concept of a multi-dimensional universe had been established by writers at DC Comics as early as the 1960's 
			to explain how the publisher could have multiple characters with the same name and powers. The respective planets 
			on which these heroes lived were dubbed <b>Earth-1</b> and <b>Earth-2</b>. As time progressed new dimensions were 
			introduced into continuity and often the storytelling became convoluted and messy, especially for longtime fans who 
			may have read decades worth of comics' stories. After the "Crisis," many characters were altered, eliminated or 
			amalgamated into a new continuity, which was intended to simplify the task of writing characters that had existed 
			for almost half a century, hopefully satisfying old fans as well as attracting new fans to the DC Universe.</p><br>
