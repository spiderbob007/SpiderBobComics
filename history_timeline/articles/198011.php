<p><span><em>Dreadstar</em> #1</span> (Nov. 1982) was the first comic published under the Epic Comics imprint, a subsidiary 
			of Marvel Comics, which allowed creators to be published and maintain the copyright to their characters and stories.</p><br />

			<p>Epic Comics was a spinoff of <em>Epic Illustrated</em>, a science fiction magazine similar to <em>Heavy Metal</em>. 
			The Epic Comics imprint sold comics only through the direct market of comic book shops, which allowed it to circumvent 
			the Comics Code Authority, and therefore provide a greater scope of liberty for the creators.</p><br /> 

			<p>Because Epic Comics was oriented toward a more mature readership, the comics were produced on higher quality paper 
			and carried a higher cover price than other titles published by Marvel Comics. Many titles were printed in a book bound 
			"prestige format" such as the Japanese manga classic <em>Akira</em>.</p><br />

			<p>Epic Comics fell victim to the comics market crash of the mid-1990's, caused primarily by overproduction and 
			speculation by collectors on titles with multiple or gimmick covers. In December, 1996 Epic's parent company, Marvel 
			Comics, was forced into bankruptcy due largely to glutting the market with too many versions of the same product via 
			alternate covers of the same issue, forays into the card collecting market, and bad distribution deals.</p><br />
