<p><span><em>Tomb of Dracula</em> #1</span> (April, 1972) featured the first long-running comic book appearance of 
			<a href="../villains/marvel/Dracula.php" target="_blank">Count Dracula</a>, the vampire created by 19<sup>th</sup> Century Irish novelist 
			Bram Stoker.</p><br />
			
			<p>Dracula had made a previous appearance in <a href="../issues/marvel/1stDracula.php" target="_blank"><em>Suspense</em> #7</a> 
			(March, 1951), before the prohibition by the Comics Code Authority on vampires, werewolves and other monsters went 
			into effect in 1954. When the CCA relaxed its prohibition on monsters in 1971, it didn't take long for classic Hollywood versions of the 
			creatures to appear in the pages of comic books.</p><br />
