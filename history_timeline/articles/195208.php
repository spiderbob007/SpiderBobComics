<p><span><em>Tales Calculated to Drive You MAD</em></span> (Aug. 1952) focusing on satire, parody, and social commentary in a humorous 
			fashion was initially published in the traditional comic's format.  After twenty-four issues of <em>Tales Calculated to Drive You MAD</em>, 
			EC Comics changed the format to a traditional glossy magazine to avoid regulation  by the recently created Comics Code Authority, an 
			industry sponsored censorship board created in response to congressional hearings in the 1950s on the link between comic books and 
			juvenile delinquency.</p><br />
