<p><span><em>The Incredible Hulk</em> #1</span> (May 1962) featured the first appearance of the 
			<a href="../heroes/marvel/HulkII.php" target="_blank">Hulk</a>, an atomic-spawned monster who was secretly a mild-mannered nuclear 
			physicist that was exposed to gamma radiation from the very bomb he created in America's quest to battle against 
			the Soviet Union.</p><br />
			
			<p>Not since Frankenstein's monster had a protagonist been a monster. Both a hero and villain the Hulk is considered a menace by 
			the public and the government, which often hunts and hounds the jade giant with the full force of the military.</p><br />

			<p>Although <em>The Incredible Hulk</em> was canceled after six issues, the character eventually returned a few years 
			later as a featured character in the pages of <em>Tales to Astonish</em>, a comic that was retitled <em>The Incredible 
			Hulk</em> with issue #102, leaving an obvious gap in the numbering of the title. The Hulk would prove popular enough 
			to become the subject of a critically acclaimed prime-time live-action television series from 1978-1982.</p><br />
