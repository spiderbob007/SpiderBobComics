			<p>The American comic-book industry was born in New York City in 1935 when Malcolm Wheeler-Nicholson's National Allied Publications 
			published <em>New Fun the Big Comic Magazine</em>. From this first foray into a new form of printed media DC Comics was born; creating 
			iconic comic-book characters such as <a href="../heroes/dc/Superman.php" target="_blank">Superman</a>, 
			<a href="../heroes/dc/BatmanI.php" target="_blank">Batman</a>, <a href="../heroes/dc/WonderWomanI.php" target="_blank">Wonder Woman</a>, 
			<a href="../heroes/dc/FlashII.php" target="_blank">Flash</a>, and <a href="../heroes/dc/GreenLanternII.php" target="_blank">Green Lantern</a>.  
			Dozens of imitators would rise and fall in the newly created industry, their chief competitor Timely Comics, later renamed Marvel Comics, is the 
			only competing publisher to last a long as DC Comics.</p><br />
			
			<p>Through a series of corporate acquisitions, DC Comics would eventually become part of the media conglomerate Warner Brothers Entertainment,
			a movie studio based in Burbank, California. Warner Brothers created the DC Entertainment division also based in Burbank in 2009 to manage 
			various media capitalizing on the characters of the DC Universe and other intellectual property managed by the Manhattan-based publisher.</p><br />
			
			<p>Warner announced in 2013 that DC Comics would be relocating from its 1700 Broadway address in New York to the DC Entertainment offices in 
			Burbank to bring the publishing division closer to its animation, television, and movie divisions. On April 10, 2015 DC Comics officially closed its east-coast 
			offices in the heart of the "Big Apple" and moved from the city of its birth 80 years prior to the west-coast sunshine of the Hollywood Hills.</p><br />
