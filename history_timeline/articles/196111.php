<p><span><em>The Fantastic Four</em> #1</span> (Nov. 1961) featured the first appearance of the 
			<a href="../teams/marvel/FantasticFour.php" target="_blank">Fantastic Four</a>, and unusual group of heroes who not only fought 
			against villains, but just as often fought amongst themselves.</p><br />

			<p>The stated goal of Marvel Comic's head writer and Editor-in-Chief, Stan Lee, was to create comics with heroes 
			that were human and had human frailties, the kind of comics that he not only would enjoy writing, but also 
			reading.</p><br />

			<p>The cast was comprised of the elastic scientist <a href="../heroes/marvel/MrFantastic.php" target="_blank">Dr. Reed Richards</a> 
			who often was tone deaf to the needs of his fellow teammates, including his fianc&#233;e, Susan Storm, who was often 
			figuratively and literally an <a href="../heroes/marvel/InvisibleWoman.php" target="_blank">Invisible Woman</a>. Amongst the team 
			members were the hot-headed and irresponsible teen-aged <a href="../heroes/marvel/HumanTorchII.php" target="_blank">Human Torch</a> 
			and the perpetually grumpy <a href="../heroes/marvel/ThingII.php" target="_blank">Thing</a> who harbors resentments against his 
			teammates because he was transformed into a creature of rock that can never look like a normal human again.</p><br />

			<p>The initial villains hearkened back to the genres of the 1950's. The first two issues featured monsters and aliens, 
			with later issues re-introducing the Golden-Age hero the <a href="../heroes/marvel/SubMariner.php" target="_blank">Sub-Mariner</a> 
			as a foil for Reed Richards and a potential suitor for the attentions of Susan Storm. The most iconic of the villains 
			introduced was the sinister scientist and sorcerer <a href="../villains/marvel/DrDoomI.php" target="_blank">Dr. Doom</a>, who became 
			the team's chief adversary.</p><br />
