<p><span>Marvel Comics goes bankrupt.</span></p><br /> 
			
			<p>Marvel Comics' desire to keep up with its fledgling rival Image Comics lead it to imitate many of its competitor's 
			styles and marketing techniques, resulting in a glut of multiple versions of the same comic, containing the same 
			content, but a different, often gimmicky cover carrying a higher price than the normal cover. Speculators, flush with 
			cash during the good economic times of the 1990's, were willing to invest in comics for a time, but the gimmicks 
			eventually turned comics' readers off. Coupled with forays into trading cards featuring comic book characters, and 
			bad distribution deals, the excessive gimmicks eventually caught up with the publisher and it was forced to reorganize 
			under Chapter 11 bankruptcy.</p><br />

			<p>Ironically one of the contributing factors in Marvel's bankruptcy was a failed project with Image Studios, 
			titled the "Onslaught Project." After an initial sales bump, due to long-running comics' titles carrying a new 
			#1 on the cover, sales quickly declined due to reader dissatisfaction with the quality of most of the comics 
			being produced. The project only lasted a year, and the original numbering of the titles was eventually resumed.</p><br />

			<p>After emerging from bankruptcy less than a year later, Marvel diversified its comic book offering to attract 
			new readers, and aggressively licensed its characters to movie studios, resulting in multiple successful film 
			franchises.</p><br />
