<p><span><em>X-Men</em> #1</span> (Sept. 1963) featured the first comic book appearance of the 
			<a href="../teams/marvel/XMen.php" target="_blank">X-Men</a>, the "Strangest Superheroes of All!"</p><br />
			
			<p>Marvel Comic's head writer and Editor-in-Chief, Stan Lee, fashioned the stories around the X-Men to be 
			allegorical of race relations in America during the 1960s. The heroes and villains of the title were all mutants, 
			who had different philosophies about the future and purpose of mutant-kind and how they would live with humans, 
			either as their equal or their masters.</p><br />

			<p>Whether intentional or not, Lee's characterizations of Professor X and Magneto paralleled that of civil rights 
			activists Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X. After the fashion of Dr. King, Professor X believed that mutants and 
			humans must learn to live in harmony with one another, while Magneto, based his philosophy on his experiences as a Jew in Nazi 
			Germany, concluding that humans and mutants would never live together in harmony, and that mutants either needed 
			a nation of their own or become the masters of humans by any means necessary.</p><br />
