<p><span><em>Detective Comics</em> #27</span> (May, 1939) featured the first appearance of 
			<a href="../heroes/dc/BatmanI.php" target="_blank">Batman</a>, who as a child witnessed the back-alley murder of his parents. Swearing 
			a childhood oath, he dedicates his mind, body and family's fortune to the eradication of crime.</p><br />

			<p>After the success of <a href="../heroes/dc/Superman.php" target="_blank">Superman</a>, National Allied Publications requested more 
			superheroes from their creators.</p><br />

			<p>In response to the publisher's request, Bill Finger and Bob Kane collaborated to create the antithesis of Superman, a man with no 
			superpowers who's obsession compelled him to dress as a bat to exploit the fear and superstition of the criminals he battled.</p><br />

			<p>In many of the Dark Knight's early adventures, the Batman had no compunction against killing members of the 
			criminal underworld, or in the case of Doctor Death, standing by as the villain was consumed by the flames of his 
			burning laboratory, leaving the Batman to watch and coldly comment "Death... to Doctor Death!"</p><br />
