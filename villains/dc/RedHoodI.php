			<p><span class="bold">Pre-Crisis</span></p>
			
			<p>A non-descript lab technician, the man who would become known as the <a href="Joker.php" target="_self">Joker</a> 
			decided to steal a million dollars and retire into obscurity. To hide identity he donned a tuxedo, red cape and 
			metallic red mask that covered his entire head as the <span class="bold">Red Hood</span>.</p><br>
			
			<p>Eluding the police and the Batman for weeks the Red Hood was finally cornered while attempting to rob the Monarch 
			Playing Card Company. Leaping from a catwalk into the chemical slurry the Red Hood swam to the Gotham River and 
			safety.</p><br>
			
			<p>Although escaping the law the Red Hood had not escaped unscathed. Removing his hood he discovered that his skin 
			had been bleached white and his hair mottled green. The shock unhinged his already unstable mind and he took on the 
			identity as the psychotic homicidal <span class="bold">Joker</span>.</p><br>
			
			<p><span class="bold">Post-Crisis</span></p>
			
			<p>His identity is a mystery. The only telling of his origin may have been a figment of his twisted imagination. 
			To quote the Joker, "If I'm going to have a past, I prefer it to be multiple choice!"</p><br>
			
			<p>According to the Joker's admittedly faulty memory, he was an out of work greeting cards writer, struggling to 
			make a career as a stand-up comedian. He and his pregnant wife were living a destitute but loving life.</p><br>
			
			<p>In an attempt to make some fast money before the birth of their child, he made a deal with a couple of members 
			of the <span class="bold">Red Hood</span> Gang to help break into a his former employer to rob the safe.</p><br>
			
			<p>The day before the caper was to go down, the future Joker was paid a visit by the police at the bar he frequented. 
			They informed him his wife had died from an electrical short, testing a baby bottle warmer.</p><br>
			
			<p>Distraught and no longer motivated to commit robbery he attempted to back out, but the gangsters advised him to 
			do so would have dire consequences.</p><br>
			
			<p>During the robbery the future Joker was selected to wear the guise of the Red Hood, which was always a random gang 
			member. The three burglars were confronted by a security guard and the 
			<a href="../../heroes/dc/BatmanI.php" target="_self">Batman</a>. Still wearing his disguise, he ran blindly down the 
			catwalk, falling into the chemical slew.</p><br>
			
			<p>Emerging down river, the water's reflection revealed his face was now bleached white and his hair mottled green. 
			This final misery broke the man's will, transforming him into the homicidal maniac called the 
			<span class="bold">Joker</span>.</p><br>
