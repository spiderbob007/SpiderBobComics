			<p>As a young boy Karl Lykos traveled with his father on an expedition to Tierra del Fuego, Argentina. Accompanying 
			them were physician, Dr. Andersson, and his young daughter Tanya.</p><br>
			
			<p>During the trip Tanya became lost within a cave where Lykos found her being attacked by gigantic pterodactyls, 
			a flying reptile believed to be long ago extinct. Driving off the pterodactyls Lykos was severely bitten. Lykos' 
			life was spared by the medical skills of Dr. Andersson and the boy would eventually live with the Anderssons after 
			his father's death.</p><br>
			
			<p>In an unexplained manner, the pterodactyl bites altered Lykos' genetics. He discovered a need to drain life energy 
			from other living beings to survive. The first unintentional victim was his dog, whom Lykos drained of life energy 
			simply by touch. Keeping his condition a secret, Lykos found himself forced to drain energy from other human beings 
			for his own survival. Never crossing the line of murder Lykos merely left his victims temporarily weakened.</p><br>
			
			<p>In time Lykos fell in love with his childhood friend Tanya, but her father refused to bless the marriage until 
			Lykos became financially secure. Vowing to win his love, Lykos became a medical student studying in the field of 
			psychotherapy. As he aged his need for life energy increased and Lykos constructed devices to drain life energy from 
			others into himself.</p><br>
			
			<p>Lykos links to the medical profession facilitated a professional relationship with 
			<a href="../../heroes/marvel/ProfessorX.php" target="_self">Professor Charles Xavier</a>, who was apparently aware 
			of Lykos' condition.</p><br>
			
			<p>Following a battle between the <a href="../../teams/marvel/XMen.php" target="_self">X-Men</a> and the robotic 
			<a href="../../vehicles_devices/marvel/Sentinels.php" target="_self">Sentinels</a>, team mate 
			<a href="../../heroes/marvel/Havok.php" target="_self">Havok</a><span> was critically injured. Believing he was the 
			only physician they could trust with the knowledge that Havok was a mutant the X-Men rushed him to Lykos' medical 
			office.</p><br>
			
			<p>After Havok's wounds were treated, Lykos' need for life energy became overwhelming and he used his equipment to 
			drain life energy from the mutant. The mutant life energy triggered a strange metamorphosis, transforming Lykos into 
			a humanoid pterodactyl. Although Lykos maintained his intelligence the transformation altered his personality, driving 
			him into madness and acts of evil. Reveling in his new found powers Lykos continued to seek out the life energy of 
			superhuman mutants to maintain his transformation into <span class="bold">Sauron</span>.</p><br>
