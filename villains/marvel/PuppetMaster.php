			<p>Born in the small Balkan nation of Transia, Phillip Masters' parents immigrated to American when he was young. 
			Although a brilliant student, Masters was unable to assimilate into society and became an outcast spending much of 
			his time making wooden marionettes and sculpting the native clay from his home country.</p><br>
			
			<p>When he attended college Masters meet fellow students Jacob Reiss and Marcia Deaton, who became his friends and 
			eventually business partners in in a scientific research center. When Reiss and Deaton married they had a daughter 
			named Alicia. Still mostly alone, Masters became jealous of Jacob Reiss and arranged to sabotage one of his research 
			projects. Noticing the lights in the research facility, Reiss went to investigate, leaving his family in the car. 
			Discovering Masters in the act of sabotage, Reiss was knocked unconscious and plunged to his death into a vat of clay 
			from Transia, which was being studied to discover the primordial conditions which promoted life on Earth.</p><br>
			
			<p>His rival destroyed, Masters was still intent on destroying Reiss' research and detonated explosives just as Marcia 
			and Alicia were entering the facility. The vaporized clay blinded Alicia and slowly poisoned Marcia eventually causing 
			her death.</p><br>
			
			<p>Unaware of Masters' crimes, Marcia married her husband's killer, before her own untimely death. Now the sole 
			custodian of Alicia; Masters taught the girl the art of sculpture, while simultaneously withdrawing from the world. 
			It was during this time of exile that he discovered the amazing properties of his native clay - which he could use to 
			control the will of others. With delusions of ruling the world his first major confrontation was to challenge the
