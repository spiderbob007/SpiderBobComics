				<p>Captain America's shield was cast by American metallurgist Dr. Myron MacLain, who was contracted

				<p>During his experiments, Dr. MacLain combined the exotic metal Wakandan Vibranium with a steel alloy, 
				with which he created a disk-shaped shield. Unfortunately he was never able to duplicate the process.</p><br>
				
				<p>The unique shield was coated with a high-temperature enamel in the colors of the American flag,
