				<p>Due to health concerns, Tony Stark radically redesigned the 
				<a href="../../heroes/marvel/IronManI.php" target="_self">Iron Man</a> 
				armor with shielded interfaces between the user and the armor.</p><br>
				
				<p>	The armor gained sentience through a peculiar sequence of events.</p><br>
				
				<p>Contracted by Sunset Bain (Madame Menace), Stark was assigned to break a series of security codes. Recognizing the codes as an the 
				intelligent program of the android Jocasta, Stark reactivated the robot's program and downloaded her into his armor's systems, later 
				uploading her into his home system's mainframe.</p><br>
				
				<p>Stark believed that the downloaded residual of Jocasta's artificial intelligence corrupted the systems of Stark's armor, which when 
				combined with a series of high-voltage electric shocks from the criminal known as Whiplash and a freak bolt of lightening and possible 
				Y2K programming glitches overloaded the system, and the armors program became sentient.</p><br>
				
				<p>Stark's initial instinct was to deactivate the armor and purge its systems. The armor convinced him of the benefits of working together. 
				This arrangement worked, until the armor began to override Stark's commands and killed Whiplash when he refused to divulge his employer. 
				Stark attempted to instruct the armor in ethics, but to no avail, which lead to the inevitable altercation where he had to don his old 
				armor to battle the new armor.</p><br>
				
				<p>Stark was easily bested by the sentient armor and taken to a remote island, where the emotion conflicted armor insisted its creator 
				become one with it. Refusing, the armor battered Stark and left him to answer an 
				<a href="../../teams/marvel/Avengers.php" target="_self">Avengers</a> distress call. 
				While gone, Stark set a series of traps in a desperate attempt to deactivate his creation. When the armor returned the ensuing battle 
				caused Stark to suffer a heart attack caused by an injury inflicted years earlier. Conflicted the armor ripped a device from its own chest 
				and attached it to Stark. The self-inflicted injury caused the armor to lose power and deactivate. In time the artificial heart would burrow 
				its way into Stark's chest replacing his organic heart.</p><br>
				
				<p>Stark used the armor's helmet to radio for help and buried it on the island.</p><br>
				
				<p>It was later revealed that the sentient armor had been subconsciously programmed by Jocasta, through protocols programmed by her creator 
				<a href="../../villains/marvel/Ultron.php" target="_self">Ultron</a> 
				as a safeguard against his own deactivation. When the armor was reactivated by the religious cult the 
				<a href="../../teams/marvel/Sons_of_Yinsen.php" target="_self">Sons of Yinsen</a>, 
				in a plan to resurrect the man who help Stark create his first armor, the sentient armor followed through on its programming and lead the 
				cult to the remains of <a href="../../villains/marvel/Ultron.php" target="_self">Ultron</a>, once again reactivating the robotic menace.</p><br>
