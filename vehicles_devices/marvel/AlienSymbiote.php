				<p><span class="bold">Note:</span> Comics fan Randy Schueller created the idea of a black 
				<a href="../../heroes/marvel/SpiderManI.php" target="_self">Spider-Man</a> costume for his entry into a contest that Marvel Comics had for 
				aspiring comics' creators in 1982. Schueller's original idea was to have the costume be all black and emblazoned with a red spider. The 
				costume was scripted to be designed by <a href="../../teams/marvel/Avengers.php" target="_self">Avenger</a> and fashion designer Janet van Dyne 
				(<a href="../../heroes/marvel/Wasp.php" target="_self">Wasp</a>), made of unstable molecules by 
				<a href="../../heroes/marvel/MrFantastic.php" target="_self">Mr. Fantastic</a> of the 
				<a href="../../teams/marvel/FantasticFour.php" target="_self">Fantastic Four</a>, with mentally-controlled cybernetic web-shooters 
				similar to <a href="../../heroes/marvel/IronManI.php" target="_self">Iron Man</a>'s gauntlets, which would allow Spider-Man to 
				mentally control the type of webbing he created.</p><br>
				
				<p>Marvel Editor in Chief, Jim Shooter, liked the idea of the black costume and offered Schueller $220 for his idea and an opportunity to script 
				the story. Although Schueller's script ideas were never used by Marvel, his idea later appeared as part of the limited series 
				<a href="../../events/marvel/SecretWarsI.php" target="_self"><i>Marvel Super-Heroes Secret Wars</i></a>.</p><br>

				<p>Before the publication of <i>Amazing Spider-Man</i> #252 comics' fans had already expressed a dislike of the black Spider-Man costume and the 
				creative team of <i>Amazing Spider-Man</i> were directed by to get rid of the costume. Because the first appearance of the black costume was to 
				appear in issue eight of <i>Marvel Super-Heroes Secret Wars</i>, seven months after its first appearance, the creative team had to create a reason 
				to keep the new costume around. As a plot device, Tom DeFalco and Ron Frenz made the costume an alien symbiote that was attempting to bond with 
				Spider-Man as its host. After the symbiote was removed using sonic waves, Spider-Man returned to his classic costume, but over time the fans 
				grew to like the black costume, which lead to the storyline that resulted in the creation of 
				<a href="../../villains/marvel/VenomI.php" target="_self">Venom</a>.</p><br>

				<p><a href="../../heroes/marvel/SpiderManI.php" target="_self">Spider-Man</a> 
				came in contact with the alien symbiote on the Beyonder's Battle World during the 
				<a href="../../events/marvel/SecretWarsI.php" target="_self">Secret Wars</a>. 
				When his familiar red and blue costume had became torn and tattered from battle he sought to replicate 
				a new costume. He heard from other heroes of a machine that could replicate clothing. Not knowing exactly 
				where the clothing replicator was Spider-Man mistakenly activated a machine that produced a little black 
				ball which slithered over his body when he touched it covering him from head to toe in a black costume.</p><br>
				
				<p>Returning to Earth, Spider-Man did not give much thought to the properties of his new costume, which 
				could imitate any clothing, dimensionally store small items and had seemingly an inexhaustible supply of 
				webbing. He became suspicious of its properties upon learning it was organic in nature. Taking an earlier 
				offer from Reed Richards (<a href="../../heroes/marvel/MrFantastic.php" target="_self">Mr. Fantastic</a>) 
				to study the costume, he discovered that it is a symbiotic organism that was attempting to fuse itself to 
				him both physically and mentally. Richards was able to use sonics to sever the bond and trap the symbiote 
				within an environmental containment cell.</p><br>
				
				<p>The symbiote would escape Richard's prison and reclaim its host. Disguising itself as the red and blue 
				Spider-Man costume, Peter Parker would not discover it was actually the symbiote until it was too late. He 
				was forced to battle the symbiote while fighting off the Vulturians, a group of convicts that had assumed 
				the technology of the <a href="../../villains/marvel/VultureII.php" target="_self">Vulture</a>, wanting to 
				prove their mettle by defeating Spider-Man. After defeating the Vulturians, Spider-Man resolved himself to 
				be free of the symbiote by gambling the ringing bell of a local church tower would drive the symbiote away 
				before he would succumb to the ear shattering noise. The symbiote was driven away, but Parker became 
				unconscious and lay dying. The symbiote, which had been bound to Parker long enough to presumably assume 
				his sense of duty and responsibility, would seemingly sacrifice itself to save its host by dragging him down 
				the bell tower's stairs.</p><br>
				
				<p>Weak and dying, the symbiote would tune into the emotions of Eddie Brock, a reporter who blamed Spider-Man 
				for his failed marriage and career as a journalist. Brock's series of articles written on the confessions of 
				the murdering vigilante known as the Sin-Eater were exposed to be the ramblings of a compulsive confessor, 
				after Spider-Man captured the actual killer, police officer Stan Carter. Adding further misery to his personal 
				and professional failures Brock was dying of cancer and had gone to the church to beg forgiveness from God for 
				contemplating suicide. The symbiote detecting Brock's strong emotions about Spider-Man bound itself to the new 
				host becoming <span class="bold">Venom</span>.</p><br>
